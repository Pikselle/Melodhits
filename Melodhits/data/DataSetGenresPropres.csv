Tripping   yeah   I guess she had a point   didn't she?   A bunch of stereotypes all in my head   I remember doing the math   like   ""Yeah   I'm good at little league""   A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant   For those that like the same sex had the characteristics   The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision   And you can be cured with some treatment and religion   Man-made   rewiring of a pre-disposition   playing God   Ahh   nah   here we go   America the brave still fears what we don't know   And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten   But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago   I don't know   And I can't change   Even if I tried   Even if I wanted to   And I can't change   Even if I tried   Even if I wanted to   My love   my love   my love   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me   Have you read the YouTube comments lately?

And be yourself!   When I was in church they taught me something else   If you preach hate at the service   those words aren't anointed   That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned   When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless   Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen   I might not be the same but that's not important   No freedom til we're equal   Damn right I support it   I don't know   And I can't change   Even if I tried   Even if I wanted to   And I can't change   Even if I tried   Even if I wanted to   My love   my love   my love   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   She keeps me warm   We press play   don't press pause   Progress   march on!   With a veil over our eyes   we turn our back on the cause   'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law   Kids are walking around the hallway   Plagued by pain in their heart   A world so hateful   Some would rather die   Than be who they are   And a certificate on paper   Isn't gonna solve it all   But it's a damn good place to start   No law's gonna change us   We have to change us   Whatever god you believe in   We come from the same one   Strip away the fear   underneath   it's all the same love   About time that we raised up!
