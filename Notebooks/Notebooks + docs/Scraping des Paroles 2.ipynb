I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended. Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit. Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions. They never even liked you in the first place.

Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone. But you keep my old scarf from that very first week. \\'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me. You can\\'t get rid of it. \\'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah. . [Chorus]. \\'Cause there we are again when I loved you so. Back before you lost the one real thing you\\'ve ever known.

If that means what I think it means, we\\'re in trouble, big trouble;\\xa0. And if he is as bananas as you say, I\\'m not taking any chances\". \"You are just what the doc ordered\". . [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce. You might also like[Chorus]. \\'Cause I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin\\' this shit ain\\'t that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I\\'ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I\\'ll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it\\'s all a game, \\'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin\\'?. Little gay-lookin\\' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin\\' boy (Ha-ha!). You\\'re witnessin\\' a mass-occur. Like you\\'re watching a church gathering take place, lookin\\' boy. \"Oy vey, that boy\\'s gay!\"—that\\'s all they say, lookin\\' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin\\' boy. Hey, lookin\\' boy! What you say, lookin\\' boy?. I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin\\' boy. I\\'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin\\' boy!. Basically, boy, you\\'re never gonna be capable. Of keepin\\' up with the same pace, lookin\\' boy, \\'cause—. [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I\\'m racin\\' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet\\'s Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard. . [Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed',\n '42 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePortuguêsDeutschEnglishDÁKITI Lyrics[Letra de \"DÁKITI\"]. . [Coro: Jhay Cortez].

Catch me drivin' down 405. Catch me and your girl late at night, side to side. Mustard on the beat, ho. . [Chorus]. Late at night. Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night. Long as you come through. I'ma make you cum over and over. I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to. You better never make no time for these niggas. 'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you. . [Verse 1]. I can't fuck with nobody. I can't keep livin' like this, I can't. I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't. She know that I been all in her walls like I paint. Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't. Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks. When they see me outside, I'm a high roller. I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo. And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks. Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat. And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach. I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack. Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts. She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat. She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back. Every time that we fuck, I gotta run it back. You might also like[Chorus].

I like to see your body drippin' Eliantte. I say I like the way I took ya' on a wave. I had you screamin' my name out. . [Chorus]. Late at night. Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night. Long as you come through. I'ma make you cum over and over. I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to. You better never make no time for these niggas. 'Cause when I ride, I'ma ride, ride with you. [Outro].

Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on. How many brothers fell victim to the streets?. Rest in peace, young nigga, there\\'s a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on. . [Verse 1]. As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin\\' in my jaws. Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y\\'all, incomin\\' call. Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin\\' by. It\\'s time to bury another brother, nobody cry. Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls. We used to do \\'em as adolescents, do you recall?. Raised as G\\'s, loc\\'ed out, and blazed the weed. Get on the roof, let\\'s get smoked out, and blaze with me. Two in the morning and we still high, assed out. Screamin\\', \"Thug \\'til I die!\" before I passed out. But now that you\\'re gone, I\\'m in the zone. Thinkin\\' I don\\'t wanna die all alone, but now you gone. And all I got left are stinkin\\' memories. I love them niggas to death, I\\'m drinkin\\' Hennessy. While tryin\\' to make it last. I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, \\'cause life goes on. You might also like[Chorus].

Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on. . [Verse 2]. Yeah nigga, I got the word it\\'s hell. You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L. Time to prepare to do fed time, won\\'t see parole. Imagine life as a convict that\\'s gettin\\' old. Plus with the drama, we\\'re lookin\\' out for your baby\\'s mama. Takin\\' risks, while keepin\\' cheap tricks from gettin\\' on her. Life in the hood is all good for nobody. Remember gamin\\' on dumb hotties at yo\\' party. Me and you, no truer two, while schemin\\' on hits. And gettin\\' tricks that maybe we can slide into. But now you buried — rest, nigga, \\'cause I ain\\'t worried. Eyes blurry, sayin\\' goodbye at the cemetery. Though memories fade. I got your name tatted on my arm. So we both ball \\'til my dyin\\' days. Before I say goodbye. Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug \\'til I die!. [Chorus]. How many brothers fell victim to the streets?. Rest in peace, young nigga, there\\'s a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on. How many brothers fell victim to the streets?. Rest in peace, young nigga, there\\'s a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, \\'cause life goes on. . [Verse 3]. Bury me smilin\\' with G\\'s in my pocket. Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it. Let the hoes that I used to know. From way befo\\' kiss me from my head to my toe. Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin. A couple bottles of gin, in case I don\\'t get in. Tell all my people I\\'m a Ridah. Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride. Until I get free. I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin\\' me. To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews. Niggas that guided me through back in the old school. Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies. See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me. And brothers miss you while you gone. You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on. [Chorus]. How many brothers fell victim to the streets?. Rest in peace, young nigga, there\\'s a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on. How many brothers fell victim to the streets?. Rest in peace, young nigga, there\\'s a heaven for a G. Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death. My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on. . [Outro]. Life goes on, homie. Gone on, \\'cause they passed away. Niggas doin\\' life. Niggas doin\\' 50 and 60 years and shit. I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you. You know what I mean?. Last year we poured out liquor for ya. This year, nigga, life goes on, we\\'re gonna clock now. Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks. Give playa haters plenty of space. And basically just represent for you, baby. Next time you see your niggas, we gon\\' be on top, nigga. You gon\\' be like, \"Goddamn, them niggas came up!\". That\\'s right, baby, life goes on. And we up out this bitch. Hey, Kato! Mental!. Y\\'all niggas make sure it\\'s poppin\\'. When we get up there, man, don\\'t front. Life goes on. Hold me no more, hold me no more.

Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away. I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days. I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it.

'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done. Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son. I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed. I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again. My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings. Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending. .

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me. This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy. I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know. Somebody to have, somebody to hold. It's easy to say, but it's never the same. I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain. . [Chorus]. Now, the day bleeds into nightfall. And you're not here to get me through it all. I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug. I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved. . [Verse 2]. I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to. This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you. Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear. Somebody to have, just to know how it feels. It's easy to say, but it's never the same. I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape. . [Chorus]. Now, the day bleeds into nightfall. And you're not here to get me through it all. I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug. I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved. You might also like[Bridge].

[Pre-Chorus]. We're just playin' hide and seek. It's gettin' hard to breathe. Under the sheets with you. I don't wanna play no games. I'm tired of always chasin'. Chasin' after you. . [Chorus]. I don't give a fuck about you anyways. Who ever said I give a shit 'bout you?. You never share your toys or communicate. I guess I'm just a playdate to you. [Verse 2]. Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothin' left to say. When I try to talk, you're always playin' board games. I wish I had monopoly over your mind. I wish I didn't care all the time.

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]. If Pirus and Crips all got along. They\\'d probably gun me down by the end of this song. Seem like the whole city go against me. Every time I\\'m in the street, I hear—. Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!. [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]. Man down, where you from, nigga?. Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?. Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?. This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga. [Verse: Kendrick Lamar]. Brace yourself, I\\'ll take you on a trip down memory lane. This is not a rap on how I\\'m slingin\\' crack or move cocaine. This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain. Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin\\' on your brain. It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans. It got ugly, wavin\\' yo\\' hand out the window – check yourself!. Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance. With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed. Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out. At the same burger stand where **** hang out. Now this is not a tape recorder sayin\\' that he did it. But ever since that day, I was lookin\\' at him different. That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine. Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime. Pack a van with four guns at a time. With the sliding door, fuck is up?. Fuck you shootin\\' for if you ain\\'t walkin\\' up, you fuckin\\' punk?. Pickin\\' up the fuckin\\' pump, pickin\\' off you suckers. Suck a dick or die or sucker punch. A wall of bullets comin\\' from AK\\'s, AR\\'s, \"Ayy, y\\'all—duck!\". That\\'s what Momma said when we was eatin\\' that free lunch. Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose. You killed my cousin back in \\'94, fuck yo\\' truce!. Now crawl your head in that noose. You wind up dead on the news. Ain\\'t no peace treaty, just piecin\\' BGs up to pre-approve. Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs. Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys. When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color\\'s correct. Make sure you\\'re corporate or they\\'ll be callin\\' your mother collect. They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except. When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain\\'t no threat. You movin\\' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC. Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess. \\u200bm.A.A.d. city. See Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $110You might also like[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar].

Fresh outta school \\'cause I was a high school grad\\'. Sleepin\\' in the living room of my momma\\'s pad. Reality struck, I seen the white car crash. Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed. My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him. Security guard for a month and ended up leavin\\'. In fact, I got fired, \\'cause I was inspired by all of my friends. To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in. Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up. Cocaine laced in marijuana. And they wonder why I rarely smoke now. Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin\\' at the mouth. I was straight tweakin\\', the next weekend we broke even. I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin\\'. You know the reasons but still\\'ll never know my life. Kendrick a.k.a. \"Compton\\'s Human Sacrifice\". [Interlude: MC Eiht]. G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixin\\' shit since the \\'80s, loc. Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time\\'s crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it\\'s Compton. [Verse 2: MC Eiht]. I\\'m still in the hood, loc, yeah that\\'s cool. Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules. But yeah, that\\'s like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang. And niggas that rep colors is doin\\' the same thang. Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me. A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit. Couple of IV\\'s with the fuckin\\' spray-can. Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran. Crew I\\'m finna slay, the street life I crave. Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave. Mount up, regulators in the whip. Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah. Trip, we in the hood still. So, loc, grab a strap \\'cause yeah, it\\'s so real, yeah. Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand. And a bird and ten grand\\'s where a mothafucka stand. [Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]. If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?. Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street. With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?. If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?. Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?. And it\\'s safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep. With dreams of bein\\' a lawyer or doctor. Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage. Kill \\'em all if they gossip. The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin\\' the option. Of livin\\' a lie, drown their body with toxins. Constantly drinkin\\' and drive. Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye. Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide. Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes. Probably go to the projects, I.

Nang ma-inlove ako sa'yo. 'Kala ko'y pag-ibig mo ay tunay. Pero hindi nagtagal, lumabas din ang tunay na kulay. Ang 'yong kilay, mapagmataas at laging namimintas. Pero sarili kong pera ang iyong winawaldas. Para kang sphinx, ugali mo'y napakastinks. Kung hiyain mo 'ko, talagang nakakashrink. Girlie, biddy, bye-bye, don't tell a lie. Bakit mo ako laging dini-deny?. All the goods I've done, wala man lang recognition. Mahilig kang manguleksyon, binalewala aking attention. 'Yo anyway, everyday. Iba't ibang guys ang 'yong ka-text. And then one time, nahuli kita na meron kang ka-sex. Mas gugustuhin ko pa na magpa-crucify. Kaysa harap-harapan mo akong stupify. So don't be mad, so don't be sad. Lahat ng kabulukan mo'y ilalahad. .

You might also like[Verse 2: Ben Deatha]. Buhay ko ay nag-iba simula nang makilala ka. Every hour, every minute, nais kang makita. Halos 'di kumain, makausap lang sa phone. Between you and me, until the break of dawn. No one else comes close, pangako sa isa't isa. Ngunit napatunayan mo ba na balikan ka niya?. Pinagtapat sa akin na siya'y mahal pa rin. Anong magagawa ko kundi ikaw ay palayain?. Halos isumpa sa sakit na naidulot. Pero bakit ang katulad mo, 'di pa rin malimot?. Nagmahal ako ng iba, ngunit ako'y bigo. Sa pag-ibig ko sa'yo, ako'y bilanggo. Tumingin sa salamin, naalala ang nakalipas. Masakit palang maging (What?) panakip-butas. Pero bago ang lahat ipagtatapat, sinta. Mahal kita, sincerely yours, Bendeatha. . [Chorus: All, Charlie Mak]. (Stupid) Love, soft as an easy chair. (Stupid) Love, fresh as the morning air. (Stupid) Love, love that is shared by two. (Stupid love) I have found with you. . [Verse 3: Nasty Mak]. Saan nga ba hahantong ang tagpong ito?. Minahal kita pero ako'y ginago mo. And it tooks a long time bago pa maka-recover. Sa ginawa mo sa 'kin ay meron pa akong hangover. Naaalala mo pa ba nung tayo pa?. Kasa-kasama ka 'san man ako magpunta. Pinagsilbihan kita mula ulo hanggang paa. Pati ang bra't panty mo, ako ang naglalaba. Kinukunsinte ka kung meron nagawang mali. (Oo na, oo na, sige na, tama ka naman palagi, eh). Mga inutos mo sa akin, 'di ko sinuway. Mas sinusunod na nga kita kesa sa aking nanay. Lahat na lang ng bagay, binigay ko sa iyo. Naging sunud-sunuran ako na parang aso. 'Pag may kausap kang iba, ako'y dini-deny. Basta gwapo ang guy, maaga kang bumibigay. Damn, napaka-istupido ng puso kong ito. Ano ba ang dahilan at ako ay ginanito mo?. Inaway mo ako at iyong itinaboy. At sa ibang boy, nakipaglaro ka ng apoy. Ako'y nananaghoy, puso ko ay nabiyak. Wasak na wasak ang puso ni Nasty Mak. Inaamin ko noon na minahal nga kita. Pero ngayon, binabawi ko na. [Chorus: All, Charlie Mak].

A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that\\'ll jump-start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital. By the doctor when I\\'m not co-operating.

Though I\\'m not the first king of controversy. I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley. To do Black music so selfishly. And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!). There\\'s a concept that works. Twenty million other white rappers emerge. But no matter how many fish in the sea. It\\'d be so empty without me. [Chorus: Eminem]. Now this looks like a job for me.

Niggas been countin' me out. I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips. I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list. I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit. The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit. The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit. The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty. But that's how I like it, you all on my dick. . [Verse 1]. I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get. I do not snort powder, I might take a sip. I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip. I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish. I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death. I got a few mil' but not all of them rich. What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?. What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?. That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit. Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips. Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist. This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift. Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss. They act like two legends cannot coexist. But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'. If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit. It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame. It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same. It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers. It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane. Everything grows, it's destined to change. I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came. I hope that you scrape every dollar you can. I hope you know money won't erase the pain. To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now. Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground. I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style. I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now. Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice. I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise. This year gon' be different, I set my intentions. I promise to slap all that hate out your voice.

I just poured somethin' in my cup. I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel. Promise I am never lettin' up. Money in your palm don't make you real. Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck. I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel. If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck. Pistol in your hand don't make you real. . [Verse 2]. I'm dead in the middle of two generations. I'm little bro and big bro all at once. Just left the lab with young 21 Savage. I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch. Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak. Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville. Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest. I wish that he had more guidance, for real. Too many niggas in cycle of jail. Spending they birthdays inside of a cell. We coming from a long bloodline of trauma. We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal. We hurting our sisters, the babies as well. We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well. Distorted self-image, we set up to fail. I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga. [Chorus]. I just poured somethin' in my cup. I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel. Promise I am never lettin' up. Money in your palm don't make you real. Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck. I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel. If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck. Pistol in your hand don't make you real. . [Outro]. Money in your palm don't make you real. Pistol in your hand don't make you real.

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]. The big-eared bandit is tossin\\' all his manners. In a bag and wrappin\\' them in Saran wrap bandages. Tossin\\' \\'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches. So when he says, \"Catch up, nigga,\" it looks like an accident. Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest. My bitch white and black like she\\'s been mimicking a panda. It\\'s the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada. Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela. Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain. I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton. Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic). Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit. Semen-scented cheetah printed tee. In that \\'Preme five-panel, I\\'ll repeat it for the season (Hahaha). Previous items in the present. With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team. It\\'s me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though). You might also like[Verse 2: Hodgy]. To have some type of knowledge that is one perception. But knowin\\' you own your opponent is a defeatin\\' bonus. I\\'m Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless. Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses. Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin\\'. I\\'m on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood. Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I\\'m stealin\\' your rims. Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin\\' boot. And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon\\' brrrooop. It\\'s KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop. And out my Kool-Aid, Juice. . [Verse 3: Left Brain]. What\\'s up, bitch?. Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin. Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in. Wolf Gang party at the hotel. I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell. You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah). I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat. Yup, uh, and her ass fat. Don\\'t be surprised if I ask where the hash at. Nigga, I\\'m tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what\\'s up, smoke). Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking \\'bout a lighter. Still bang salute me or just shoot me. \\'Cause if you don\\'t salute me then my team will do the shooting. Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack. The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac. We like the mafia, bitch, don\\'t get to slacking up. And if these haters acting up, throw \\'em in the aqueduct. Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don\\'t really ask for much. But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus. [Verse 4: Mike G]. (We out here). What the fuck is caution?. Often I leave \\'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins. Lost in translation, the dreams you chase. Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base. That\\'s great, I\\'m home alone dreaming of two on ones. With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on. And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp. Three lettermans that Ace has been making him. No strays while we catching matinees, huh?. I\\'m getting blazed thinking \\'bout those days. I had the top off the GT3 like toupees. One finger in the air, all\\'s fair when crime pays. My grand scheme of things is to be attached. To the game like bitches to their wedding rings. And you don\\'t even need to look \\'cause we gleam obscene. In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining. Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem. If you say, \"Get \\'em, Mike G,\" then I got \\'em. One man squadron, nigga, I\\'m a problem. From Briggs, I got bars and plans to. Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars. Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still. And if I said it then it is or it\\'s gonna be real. OF \\'til I OD and I probably will, uh. [Verse 5: Domo Genesis]. It\\'s still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped. With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not. Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin\\' drop. Bitch, I\\'m in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk. I\\'ve been runnin\\' blocks since a snotty tot. Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks. Now I\\'m all grown, same song, just a different waltz. Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop. Op, Dom next shit in your wish list. Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches. On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list. And I\\'m lifted \\'til I\\'m stiff outta this bitch. Odd in your motherfuckin\\' area (Motherfuckin\\' area). Blood clots give me five feet \\'fore I bury ya. (\\'Fore I bury ya). Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya. (Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya). Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up. And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?). Wolf Gang so you know we not givin\\' no fucks. You know me dog, I\\'m a chill in the cut. So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up. . [Interlude: Frank Ocean]. Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga. Right, right. . [Verse 6: Frank Ocean]. Rent a supercar for a day. Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze. Bro, easy on the ounce, that\\'s a lot for a day. But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?. I\\'m high and I\\'m bi, wait, I mean I\\'m straight. I\\'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes. My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day. Course you know the vibe\\'s just as fly as the rhymes. On the song, cut and you could sample the feel. Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real. Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries. Then I made a mil\\' and them psychics was liars. Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?. Humble old me had to flex for the folks. Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone. Bumping oldies off my cellular phone. Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone. Bumping oldies off my cellular phone. [Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]. Goddammit!. Rapping is stupid and it\\'s hard. Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go. [Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]. Hey, it\\'s Jasper, not even a rapper. Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster. Got a TV show, so I guess I\\'m an actor. Pothead, half-baked, lookin\\' like Chappelle. Rollin\\' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo). Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow). Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don\\'t give a shit (Woo). Catch me in the back with Miley\\'s on my lap (Shit). Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat). . [Interlude: Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt]. Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick. Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket. Fuck it, Wolf Gang. Yeah, fuck that. [Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]. Look, for contrast, here\\'s a pair of lips. Swallowin\\' sarapin, settin\\' fire to sheriff\\'s whips. (Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin\\' All-American terrorist. Crushin\\' rapper larynx to feed \\'em a fuckin\\' carrot stick. And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin\\'. And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is. Spit \\'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss. Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is. Narrow, tight line, might impair him since. I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type. Feral, fuckin\\' ill-apparel-wearin\\' pack of parasites. Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise. La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up. Raidin\\' fridges, tippin\\' over vases with a tommy gun. Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks. And sixty-day chips from fuckin\\' awesome anonymous. Call him bloated \\'til he show \\'em that the flow deluxe. Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch. Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum. And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb. The culprit of the potent punch. Scoldin\\' hot as dunkin\\' scrotum in a Folgers cup. Or Nevada, drivin\\' drunk inside a stolen truck. And shittin\\' like his colon bust. Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum. Supernova, I\\'m rollin\\' over the novices. And roamin\\' through the forest and spittin\\' cold as his porridge is. Stay gold \\'til the case closed and the story end. Post mortem porkin\\' this rap shit and record it. To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips. Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list. Stormin\\' the gate, ensurin\\' the bass. Scorchin\\', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh). Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache. Indian pack of niggas who don\\'t give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence. As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky. So see me, you can\\'t, like Crunchy Black catchin\\' a taxi. Uh, back like lateral passin\\'. With that motherfuckin\\' gladiator manner of rappin\\'. As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me. Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please. . [Verse 9: Tyler, the Creator]. OF, shit, that\\'s all I got. From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac. From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak. Shreddin\\' down \\'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin\\' block. Storefront, knee tat. Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks. And grip tape... and my shoes. Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut. Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it. I started an empire, I ain\\'t even old enough. To drink a fucking beer, I\\'m tipsy off this soda pop. This is for the niggers in the suburbs. And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word. And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd. \\'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg. They say we ain\\'t actin\\' right. Always try to turn our fuckin\\' color into black and white. But they\\'ll never change \\'em, never understand \\'em. Radical\\'s my anthem, turn my fuckin\\' amps up. So instead of critiquing and bitchin\\', bein\\' mad as fuck. Just admit, not only are we talented, we\\'re rad as fuck, bitches. .

Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be. The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth. And since birth I\\'ve been cursed with this curse to just curse. And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works. And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve. All this tension, dispensin\\' these sentences. Gettin\\' this stress that\\'s been eatin\\' me recently off. Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully). But at least have the decency in you. To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out. In the streets when I\\'m eatin\\' or feedin\\' my daughter. To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don\\'t know you.

When you don\\'t give a fuck, when you won\\'t just put up. With the bullshit they pull, \\'cause they full of shit too. When a dude\\'s gettin\\' bullied and shoots up his school.

I'm a knife in your pit, raging bull on no bullpit. We ain't the same, miss me with your bullshit. 4 clips, my movie packed with materiel. Eating y'all for breakfast, nigga I'm so cereal. Word to Al Gore and South Park. I'm a south paw, that'll leave ya body south parked. That means I'm stopping this drive, when I hope in my ride. Popping up, like a cop in disguise. Surprise poppin a nine. Popping his eyes, poppin his pops. And then guy's I'm don ameche. Only three times as pompous with lines. 5 bags of crack, ain't as dope as my word shit. This shit comes natural, no need to rehearse this. Perfect. I could do this blindfolded on a typewriter. Turning white girl's faces reder than a five-rider. You might also like[Hook].

Get paid, I'm eating, but only what's on your plate. Ingest, flipped bread, invest in my interest. Keep acting bulletproof, till I put em' in vests. My intent is to invent, something to kill you. Cause I don't fuck with you fam, this ain't incest. Burn some incense, as I'm burning the sour. Say it again, I'm burning y'all. And y'all niggas' sour. I'm ill, and you can't take it out of context.

Making sure it ain't sweet for you niggas. With some sour spits. Dishing that rock, that leaves kryptonians powerless. As soon I step foot in this bitch,  I fucking deflower it. An illy spitter, forever knows as a witty nigga. Cause these other kats, are on some pussy shit like kitty litter. Boy I'm raw, all my opposes are corn hoes. Bars fucking shocking, like Blanca doing porno. Born so sick, doctors couldn't find a cure for me. So I evolved, and made songs from impurities. [?] versus me. Murdering a burglary. The blind showed the deaf. The deaf said they've heard of me. Urgentcy. Hip-hop's awaiting my arrival. For its revival, I'm one unrivaled. Psycho, trahshing all these others rappers who recycle. The same bullshit, now I'll break it out its cycle. I'm ghost. [Hook]. Got an issue, then get it off your chest, Ho. Otherwise, I suggest that you let go. Everybody says I'm so disrespectful.

Let\\'s keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit. You ever been inside a federal court room?. Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?. Bein\\' broke did somethin\\' to my spirit. Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn\\'t hear me. Look at me now, drivin\\' German engineering. You don\\'t want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me. Kilroy, \\'member when I used to use your L\\'s. To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?. Mu, \\'member when you had them green things mailed?. With vacuum seals, tryin\\' not to have them green things smelled?. Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?. I don\\'t know nothin\\', I just used to see \\'em walk to the Coney. I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody. Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer. My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe. Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow. How you think I won best dressed with no support?. And had them paid lawyers comin\\' in and out of court. Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain\\'t it a blessing?. We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?. After the pre-trials, after the status. After them impact statements, after the castle.

When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us. Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile. Brick mile, knock your bitch down. Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out. Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud. Yes I\\'ll slap a pussy nigga if he act out. Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers. Bro, kill me if I snitch, \\'cause if you snitch I\\'m gon\\' kill ya. Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas. Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein\\' silly. I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga. \\'Cause I do it better, plus I\\'m doin\\' better than niggas.

When you take off, don\\'t look back and try to rescue them niggas. You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas. Don\\'t let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga. So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it. Here go some extras, so if I\\'m busy you can manage. Fiends had me Blade dancin\\', eating sixty dollar salads. Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge. My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower.

You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on. What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio. You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers. Whoever feelin\\' hot, that AR got a heat sensor. Cuz said don\\'t entertain them hungry niggas. I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas. Don\\'t call my phone, I don\\'t want to do no song with niggas. And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga. I don\\'t know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?. Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas. Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein\\' niggas. Shoot the smile off your face, I don\\'t joke with niggas. Boy, I can\\'t trust you with that strap if you ain\\'t got no bodies. Boy, I can\\'t take you on no lick if you ain\\'t robbed nobody. You ain\\'t no shooter, you can\\'t do that shit without no molly. I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari. Thirty months ago niggas ain\\'t think that I was comin\\' home. Shout out to them niggas\\' freaks that I been cummin\\' on. Get \\'em to the crib, bust \\'em down, now bitch run along. This SK\\'ll get to shakin\\' like there\\'s somethin\\' wrong. Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone. The feds say my name hot like when the oven on. Bitch, I came home to my lil\\' brother gone. Niggas say they lookin\\' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone. Who said I\\'m a snitch? You just heard a lie from him. Better check the black and white. That paperwork will vouch for him. Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him. He don\\'t want that pistol play? Okay I\\'ll Tyson him.

If that means what I think it means, we\\'re in trouble, big trouble;\\xa0. And if he is as bananas as you say, I\\'m not taking any chances\". \"You are just what the doc ordered\". . [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce. You might also like[Chorus]. \\'Cause I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin\\' this shit ain\\'t that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I\\'ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I\\'ll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it\\'s all a game, \\'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin\\'?. Little gay-lookin\\' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin\\' boy (Ha-ha!). You\\'re witnessin\\' a mass-occur. Like you\\'re watching a church gathering take place, lookin\\' boy. \"Oy vey, that boy\\'s gay!\"—that\\'s all they say, lookin\\' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin\\' boy. Hey, lookin\\' boy! What you say, lookin\\' boy?. I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin\\' boy. I\\'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin\\' boy!. Basically, boy, you\\'re never gonna be capable. Of keepin\\' up with the same pace, lookin\\' boy, \\'cause—. [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I\\'m racin\\' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet\\'s Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard. . [Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed',\n '215 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeRic Flair Drip Lyrics[Intro]. (Bijan 4 The 1 Time). Metro Boomin want some more, nigga! (Hey). . [Chorus].

As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.. . Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.. . Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).. . But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.. . She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.. . “It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”. . But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.. . “You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”. . The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.). . Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.. . The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.. Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.. . Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.. . Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.. . Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.. . But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).. . She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”. . After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”. . “The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.. . “I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”. . The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.. . Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.. . “I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”. . So she was basically singing into the toilet?. “Yep.”. . “She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”. . But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.. . When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:. . *When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*. . I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.. . *Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*. . I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.. . *Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*. . No.. . *Have you reached out directly?*. I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.. . *When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*. . I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.. Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.. . “The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”. . Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.. . Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.. . “My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”. . (Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.). . Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.. . She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”. . After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”. . Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.. . Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.. . She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.. . Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.). . And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:. . “I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”. . A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.. . “I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.. . “It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”. . The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.. . They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”. . “Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”. . Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.. . Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.. . Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.. . “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”. . In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.. . “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.. . Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.. . “It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”. . She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.. . “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”. . If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:. . “We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”Embed\",\n \"2 ContributorsNew Music Friday 12/09/16 LyricsSteve Aoki - Just Hold On feat.

The ruins of the dead painted with a scar. And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try. The feelings start to rot one wink at a time. . [Chorus 1]. Oh-oh. Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain. Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away. When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded. Horrified with each stone. On the stage, my little dark age. . [Verse 2]. Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby. The carvings on the face say they find it hard. And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise. The humor's not the same, coming from denial. . [Chorus 2]. Oh-oh. I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange. I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away. If you get out of bed and find me standing. All alone, open-eyed. Burn the page, my little dark age. You might also like[Interlude]. (Little dark age, little dark age).

Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns. I know my friends and I would probably turn and run. If you get out of bed, come find us heading. For the bridge, bring a stone.

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce.

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I\\'ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I\\'ll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it\\'s all a game, \\'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin\\'?. Little gay-lookin\\' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin\\' boy (Ha-ha!). You\\'re witnessin\\' a mass-occur.

[Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not.

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar. She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar. She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?. Said it was one of my friend\\'s songs, do you want to drink on?. She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun. She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun. Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar. Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance. . [Chorus]. You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band. But she fell in love with an English man. Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand. Said, \"Baby, I just want to dance\". With my pretty little Galway Girl. You\\'re my pretty little Galway Girl. . [Verse 2]. You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool. And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room. As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool. After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes. I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet. A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat.

To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine. I swear I\\'m gonna put you in a song that I write. About a Galway Girl and a perfect night. . [Chorus]. She played the fiddle in an Irish band.

Before you make your mind up, hear me. I just want you to see things clearly. This should be about love, not money. Don't let him try to take you from me. I don't wanna have to apologize. I don't wanna feel I've been penalized. Just 'cause I can drive in a better car. Live in a bigger house just like a superstar. He says that I can only give you. Material things, but that's not true. You see my heart is rich with love for you. Don't let him make you doubt my love for you. Yeah, baby. I work hard for my money. No one gave it to me. But some fools think the deeper the pocket. The smaller the heart will be, not true. I'm only tryin' to share me with you. Look at all the lovin' we do. Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'. I'm not just another player playin'. I don't wanna have to apologize (or give a damn). And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am). Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things. Or take you anyplace. That's just what money brings. He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love. 'Cause that's what he would do. He thinks since he's a man with nothing. That he's got better love for you. No way. Tell him now, let him go. Or I can no longer be yours. Tell him how you feel about me. I can't keep standing on the side. Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me. Leave him with his fallacies. I don't care what bull he believes. Tell him that enough is enough. Just don't return a disbeliever. You've always been a willing receiver of my love. I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this). I don't wanna feel like I'm penalized (for being rich). Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand. I'm bein' my true self. Just doin' what I can. He thinks I won you with materiality. But honey, you know that's not so. And even if he understood me. It's simply time for him to go---so let him go!. I don't wanna change you. 'cause I'm in love with who you are. So I don't wanna apologize for bein' a superstar. Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?. What am I guilty of?. What did or didn't I do?. Maybe I can't be myself with somebody. Who believes such things are true. I'm losing self-respect from trying. I'm losing my desire too---I can't do it. I don't wanna have to apologize (or give a damn). I don't wanna feel I've been penalized (for who I am). Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things. Or take you anyplace. That's just what money brings. He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love. 'Cause that's what he would doYou might also likeEmbed\",\n \"3 ContributorsNew Music Friday 02/24/17 LyricsZedd & Alessia Cara - Stay.

On the day of San Giovanni it was already three weeks ago that Tito had handed his florins to Cennini, and we have seen that as he set out towards the Via de’ Bardi he showed all the outward signs of a mind at ease. How should it be otherwise? He never jarred with what was immediately around him, and his nature was too joyous, too unapprehensive, for the hidden and the distant to grasp him in the shape of a dread. As he turned out of the hot sunshine into the shelter of a narrow street, took off the black cloth berretta, or simple cap with upturned lappet, which just crowned his brown curls, pushing his hair and tossing his head backward to court the cooler air, there was no brand of duplicity on his brow; neither was there any stamp of candour: it was simply a finely-formed, square, smooth young brow. And the slow absent glance he cast around at the upper windows of the houses had neither more dissimulation in it, nor more ingenuousness, than belongs to a youthful well-opened eyelid with its unwearied breadth of gaze; to perfectly pellucid lenses; to the undimmed dark of a rich brown iris; and to a pure cerulean-tinted angle of whiteness streaked with the delicate shadows of long eyelashes. Was it that Tito’s face attracted or repelled according to the mental attitude of the observer? Was it a cypher with more than one key? The strong, unmistakable expression in his whole air and person was a negative one, and it was perfectly veracious; it declared the absence of any uneasy claim, any restless vanity, and it made the admiration that followed him as he passed among the troop of holiday-makers a thoroughly willing tribute.. . For by this time the stir of the Festa was felt even in the narrowest side-streets; the throng which had at one time been concentrated in the lines through which the procession had to pass, was now streaming out in all directions in pursuit of a new object. Such intervals of a Festa are precisely the moments when the vaguely active animal spirits of a crowd are likely to be the most petulant and most ready to sacrifice a stray individual to the greater happiness of the greater number. As Tito entered the neighbourhood of San Martino, he found the throng rather denser; and near the hostelry of the Bertucce, or Baboons, there was evidently some object which was arresting the passengers and forming them into a knot. It needed nothing of great interest to draw aside passengers unfreighted with a purpose, and Tito was preparing to turn aside into an adjoining street, when, amidst the loud laughter, his ear discerned a distressed childish voice crying,. . “Loose me! Holy Virgin, help me!”. . which at once determined him to push his way into the knot of gazers. He had just had time to perceive that the distressed voice came from a young contadina, whose white hood had fallen off in the struggle to get her hands free from the grasp of a man in the parti-coloured dress of a cerretano, or conjuror, who was making laughing attempts to soothe and cajole her, evidently carrying with him the amused sympathy of the spectators. These, by a persuasive variety of words signifying simpleton, for which the Florentine dialect is rich in equivalents, seemed to be arguing with the contadina against her obstinacy. At the first moment the girl’s face was turned away, and he saw only her light-brown hair plaited and fastened with a long silver pin; but in the next, the struggle brought her face opposite Tito’s, and he saw the baby features of Tessa, her blue eyes filled with tears, and her under-lip quivering. Tessa, too, saw him, and through the mist of her swelling tears there beamed a sudden hope, like that in the face of a little child, when, held by a stranger against its will, it sees a familiar hand stretched out.. . In an instant Tito had pushed his way through the barrier of bystanders, whose curiosity made them ready to turn aside at the sudden interference of this handsome young signor, had grasped Tessa’s waist, and had said,. . “Loose this child! What right have you to hold her against her will?”. . The conjuror—a man with one of those faces in which the angles of the eyes and eyebrows, of the nostrils, mouth, and sharply-defined jaw, all tend upward—showed his small regular teeth in an impish but not ill-natured grin, as he let go Tessa’s hands, and stretched out his own backward, shrugging his shoulders, and bending them forward a little in a half-apologetic, half-protesting manner.. . “I mean the ragazza no evil in the world, Messere: ask this respectable company. I was only going to show them a few samples of my skill, in which this little damsel might have helped me the better because of her kitten face, which would have assured them of open dealing; and I had promised her a lapful of confetti as a reward. But what then? Messer has doubtless better confetti at hand, and she knows it.”. . A general laugh among the bystanders accompanied these last words of the conjuror, raised, probably, by the look of relief and confidence with which Tessa clung to Tito’s arm, as he drew it from her waist, and placed her hand within it. She only cared about the laugh as she might have cared about the roar of wild beasts from which she was escaping, not attaching any meaning to it; but Tito, who had no sooner got her on his arm than he foresaw some embarrassment in the situation, hastened to get clear of observers who, having been despoiled of an expected amusement, were sure to re-establish the balance by jests.. . “See, see, little one! here is your hood,”. . said the conjuror, throwing the bit of white drapery over Tessa’s head.. . “Orsù, bear me no malice; come back to me when Messere can spare you.”. . “Ah! Maestro Vaiano, she’ll come back presently, as the toad said to the harrow,” called out one of the spectators, seeing how Tessa started and shrank at the action of the conjuror.. Tito pushed his way vigorously towards the corner of a side-street, a little vexed at this delay in his progress to the Via de’ Bardi, and intending to get rid of the poor little contadina as soon as possible. The next street, too, had its passengers inclined to make holiday remarks on so unusual a pair; but they had no sooner entered it than he said, in a kind but hurried manner,. . “Now, little one, where were you going? Are you come by yourself to the Festa?”. . “Ah, no!” said Tessa,. . looking frightened and distressed again;. . “I have lost my mother in the crowd—her and my father-in-law. They will be angry—he will beat me. It was in the crowd in San Pulinari—somebody pushed me along and I couldn’t stop myself, so I got away from them. Oh, I don’t know where they’re gone! Please, don’t leave me!”. . Her eyes had been swelling with tears again, and she ended with a sob.. . Tito hurried along again: the Church of the Badia was not far off. They could enter it by the cloister that opened at the back, and in the church he could talk to Tessa—perhaps leave her. No! it was an hour at which the church was not open; but they paused under the shelter of the cloister, and he said,. . “Have you no cousin or friend in Florence, my little Tessa, whose house you could find; or are you afraid of walking by yourself since you have been frightened by the conjuror? I am in a hurry to get to Oltrarno, but if I could take you anywhere near—”. . “Oh, I am frightened: he was the devil—I know he was. And I don’t know where to go. I have nobody: and my mother meant to have her dinner somewhere, and I don’t know where. Holy Madonna! I shall be beaten.”. . The corners of the pouting mouth went down piteously, and the poor little bosom with the beads on it above the green serge gown heaved so, that there was no longer any help for it: a loud sob would come, and the big tears fell as if they were making up for lost time. Here was a situation! It would have been brutal to leave her, and Tito’s nature was all gentleness. He wished at that moment that he had not been expected in the Via de’ Bardi. As he saw her lifting up her holiday apron to catch the hurrying tears, he laid his hand, too, on the apron, and rubbed one of the cheeks and kissed the baby-like roundness.. . “My poor little Tessa! leave off crying. Let us see what can be done. Where is your home—where do you live?”. . There was no answer, but the sobs began to subside a little and the drops to fall less quickly.. . “Come! I’ll take you a little way, if you’ll tell me where you want to go.”. The apron fell, and Tessa’s face began to look as contented as a cherub’s budding from a cloud. The diabolical conjuror, the anger and the beating, seemed a long way off.. . “I think I’ll go home, if you’ll take me,” she said,. . in a half whisper, looking up at Tito with wide blue eyes, and with something sweeter than a smile—with a childlike calm.. . “Come, then, little one,” said Tito,. . in a caressing tone, putting her arm within his again.. . “Which way is it?”. . “Beyond Peretola—where the large pear-tree is.”. . “Peretola? Out at which gate, pazzarella? I am a stranger, you must remember.”. . “Out at the Por del Prato,” said Tessa,. . moving along with a very fast hold on Tito’s arm.. . He did not know all the turnings well enough to venture on an attempt at choosing the quietest streets; and besides, it occurred to him that where the passengers were most numerous there was, perhaps, the most chance of meeting with Monna Ghita and finding an end to his knight-errant-ship. So he made straight for Porta Rossa, and on to Ognissanti, showing his usual bright propitiatory face to the mixed observers who threw their jests at him and his little heavy-shod maiden with much liberality. Mingled with the more decent holiday-makers there were frolicsome apprentices, rather envious of his good fortune; bold-eyed women with the badge of the yellow veil; beggars who thrust forward their caps for alms, in derision at Tito’s evident haste; dicers, sharpers, and loungers of the worst sort; boys whose tongues were used to wag in concert at the most brutal street games: for the streets of Florence were not always a moral spectacle in those times, and Tessa’s terror at being lost in the crowd was not wholly unreasonable.. . When they reached the Piazza d’Ognissanti, Tito slackened his pace: they were both heated with their hurried walk, and here was a wider space where they could take breath. They sat down on one of the stone benches which were frequent against the walls of old Florentine houses.. . “Holy Virgin!” said Tessa;. “I am glad we have got away from those women and boys; but I was not frightened, because you could take care of me.”. . “Pretty little Tessa!” said Tito,. . smiling at her. “What makes you feel so safe with me?”. . “Because you are so beautiful—like the people going into Paradise: they are all good.”. . “It is a long while since you had your breakfast, Tessa,” said Tito,. . seeing some stalls near, with fruit and sweetmeats upon them.. . “Are you hungry?”. . “Yes, I think I am—if you will have some too.”. . Tito bought some apricots, and cakes, and comfits, and put them into her apron.. . “Come,” he said,. . “let us walk on to the Prato, and then perhaps you will not be afraid to go the rest of the way alone.”. . “But you will have some of the apricots and things,” said Tessa,. . rising obediently and gathering up her apron as a bag for her store.. . “We will see,” said Tito aloud;. . and to himself he said, “Here is a little contadina who might inspire a better idyl than Lorenzo de’ Medici’s ‘Nencia da Barberino,’ that Nello’s friends rave about; if I were only a Theocritus, or had time to cultivate the necessary experience by unseasonable walks of this sort! However, the mischief is done now: I am so late already that another half-hour will make no difference. Pretty little pigeon!”. . “We have a garden and plenty of pears,” said Tessa,. . “and two cows, besides the mules; and I’m very fond of them. But my father-in-law is a cross man: I wish my mother had not married him. I think he is wicked; he is very ugly.”. . “And does your mother let him beat you, poverina? You said you were afraid of being beaten.”. . “Ah, my mother herself scolds me: she loves my young sister better, and thinks I don’t do work enough. Nobody speaks kindly to me, only the Pievano (parish priest) when I go to confession. And the men in the Mercato laugh at me and make fun of me. Nobody ever kissed me and spoke to me as you do; just as I talk to my little black-faced kid, because I’m very fond of it.”. . It seemed not to have entered Tessa’s mind that there was any change in Tito’s appearance since the morning he begged the milk from her, and that he looked now like a personage for whom she must summon her little stock of reverent words and signs. He had impressed her too differently from any human being who had ever come near her before, for her to make any comparison of details; she took no note of his dress; he was simply a voice and a face to her, something come from Paradise into a world where most things seemed hard and angry; and she prattled with as little restraint as if he had been an imaginary companion born of her own lovingness and the sunshine.. . They had now reached the Prato, which at that time was a large open space within the walls, where the Florentine youth played at their favourite Calcio—a peculiar kind of football—and otherwise exercised themselves. At this mid-day time it was forsaken and quiet to the very gates, where a tent had been erected in preparation for the race. On the border of this wide meadow, Tito paused and said—. . “Now, Tessa, you will not be frightened if I leave you to walk the rest of the way by yourself. Addio! Shall I come and buy a cup of milk from you in the Mercato to-morrow morning, to see that you are quite safe?”. . He added this question in a soothing tone, as he saw her eyes widening sorrowfully, and the corners of her mouth falling. She said nothing at first; she only opened her apron and looked down at her apricots and sweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly—. . “I thought you would have some, and we could sit down under a tree outside the gate, and eat them together.”. . “Tessa, Tessa, you little siren, you would ruin me,” said Tito, laughing, and kissing both her cheeks.. . “I ought to have been in the Via de’ Bardi long ago. No! I must go back now; you are in no danger. There—I’ll take an apricot. Addio!”. . He had already stepped two yards from her when he said the last word. Tessa could not have spoken; she was pale, and a great sob was rising; but she turned round as if she felt there was no hope for her, and stepped on, holding her apron so forgetfully that the apricots began to roll out on the grass.. . Tito could not help looking after her, and seeing her shoulders rise to the bursting sob, and the apricots fall—could not help going after her and picking them up. It was very hard upon him: he was a long way off the Via de’ Bardi, and very near to Tessa.. . “See, my silly one,” he said,. . picking up the apricots. “Come, leave off crying, I will go with you, and we’ll sit down under the tree. Come, I don’t like to see you cry; but you know I must go kick some time.”. . So it came to pass that they found a great plane-tree not far outside the gates, and they sat down under it, and all the feast was spread out on Tessa’s lap, she leaning with her back against the trunk of the tree, and he stretched opposite to her, resting his elbows on the rough green growth cherished by the shade, while the sunlight stole through the boughs and played about them like a winged thing. Tessa’s face was all contentment again, and the taste of the apricots and sweetmeats seemed very good.. . “You pretty bird!” said Tito,. . looking at her as she sat eyeing the remains of the feast with an evident mental debate about saving them, since he had said he would not have any more.. . “To think of any one scolding you! What sins do you tell of at confession, Tessa?”. . “Oh, a great many. I am often naughty. I don’t like work, and I can’t help being idle, though I know I shall be beaten and scolded; and I give the mules the best fodder when nobody sees me, and then when the Madre is angry I say I didn’t do it, and that makes me frightened at the devil. I think the conjuror was the devil. I am not so frightened after I’ve been to confession. And see, I’ve got a Breve here that a good father, who came to Prato preaching this Easter, blessed and gave us all.”. . Here Tessa drew from her bosom a tiny bag carefully fastened up.. . “And I think the holy Madonna will take care of me; she looks as if she would; and perhaps if I wasn’t idle, she wouldn’t let me be beaten.”. . “If they are so cruel to you, Tessa, shouldn’t you like to leave them, and go and live with a beautiful lady who would be kind to you, if she would have you to wait upon her?”. . Tessa seemed to hold her breath for a moment or two. Then she said doubtfully, “I don’t know.”. . “Then should you like to be my little servant, and live with me?” said Tito,. . smiling. He meant no more than to see what sort of pretty look and answer she would give.. . There was a flush of joy immediately.. . “Will you take me with you now? Ah! I shouldn’t go home and be beaten then.”. . She paused a little while, and then added more doubtfully,. . “But I should like to fetch my black-faced kid.”. . “Yes, you must go back to your kid, my Tessa,” said Tito,. . rising, “and I must go the other way.”. . “By Jupiter!” he added,. . as he went from under the shade of the tree,. . “it is not a pleasant time of day to walk from here to the Via de’ Bardi; I am more inclined to lie down and sleep in this shade.”. . It ended so. Tito had an unconquerable aversion to anything unpleasant, even when an object very much loved and desired was on the other side of it. He had risen early; had waited; had seen sights, and had been already walking in the sun: he was inclined for a siesta, and inclined all the more because little Tessa was there, and seemed to make the air softer. He lay down on the grass again, putting his cap under his head on a green tuft by the side of Tessa. That was not quite comfortable; so he moved again, and asked Tessa to let him rest his head against her lap; and in that way he soon fell asleep. Tessa sat quiet as a dove on its nest, just venturing, when he was fast asleep, to touch the wonderful dark curls that fell backward from his ear. She was too happy to go to sleep—too happy to think that Tito would wake up, and that then he would leave her, and she must go home. It takes very little water to make a perfect pool for a tiny fish, where it will find its world and paradise all in one, and never have a presentiment of the dry bank. The fretted summer shade, and stillness, and the gentle breathing of some loved life near—it would be paradise to us all, if eager thought, the strong angel with the implacable brow, had not long since closed the gates.. . It really was a long while before the waking came—before the long dark eyes opened at Tessa, first with a little surprise, and then with a smile, which was soon quenched by some preoccupying thought. Tito’s deeper sleep had broken into a doze, in which he felt himself in the Via de’ Bardi, explaining his failure to appear at the appointed time. The clear images of that doze urged him to start up at once to a sitting posture, and as he stretched his arms and shook his cap, he said—. . “Tessa, little one, you have let me sleep too long. My hunger and the shadows together tell me that the sun has done much travel since I fell asleep. I must lose no more time. Addio,” he ended,. . patting her cheek with one hand, and settling his cap with the other.. . She said nothing, but there were signs in her face which made him speak again in as serious and as chiding a tone as he could command—. . “Now, Tessa, you must not cry. I shall be angry; I shall not love you if you cry. You must go home to your black-faced kid, or if you like you may go back to the gate and see the horses start. But I can stay with you no longer, and if you cry, I shall think you are troublesome to me.”. . The rising tears were checked by terror at this change in Tito’s voice. Tessa turned very pale, and sat in trembling silence, with her blue eyes widened by arrested tears.. . “Look now,” Tito went on,. . soothingly, opening the wallet that hung at his belt,. . “here is a pretty charm that I have had a long while—ever since I was in Sicily, a country a long way off.”. . His wallet had many little matters in it mingled with small coins, and he had the usual difficulty in laying his finger on the right thing. He unhooked his wallet, and turned out the contents on Tessa’s lap. Among them was his onyx ring.. . “Ah, my ring!” he exclaimed,. . slipping it on the forefinger of his right-hand.. . “I forgot to put it on again this morning. Strange, I never missed it! See, Tessa,” he added,. . as he spread out the smaller articles, and selected the one he was in search of.. . “See this pretty little pointed bit of red coral—like your goat’s horn, is it not?—and here is a hole in it, so you can put it on the cord round your neck along with your Breve, and then the evil spirits can’t hurt you: if you ever see them coming in the shadow round the corner, point this little coral horn at them, and they will run away. It is a ‘buona fortuna,’ and will keep you from harm when I am not with you. Come, undo the cord.”. . Tessa obeyed with a tranquillising sense that life was going to be something quite new, and that Tito would be with her often. All who remember their childhood remember the strange vague sense, when some new experience came, that everything else was going to be changed, and that there would be no lapse into the old monotony. So the bit of coral was hung beside the tiny bag with the scrap of scrawled parchment in it, and Tessa felt braver.. . “And now you will give me a kiss,” said Tito, economising time by speaking while he swept in the contents of the wallet and hung it at his waist again, “and look happy, like a good girl, and then—”. . But Tessa had obediently put forward her lips in a moment, and kissed his cheek as he hung down his head.. . “Oh, you pretty pigeon!” cried Tito,. . laughing, pressing her round cheeks with his hands and crushing her features together so as to give them a general impartial kiss.. . Then he started up and walked away, not looking round till he was ten yards from her, when he just turned and gave a parting beck. Tessa was looking after him, but he could see that she was making no signs of distress. It was enough for Tito if she did not cry while he was present. The softness of his nature required that all sorrow should be hidden away from him.. . “I wonder when Romola will kiss my cheek in that way?” thought Tito,. . as he walked along. It seemed a tiresome distance now, and he almost wished he had not been so soft-hearted, or so tempted to linger in the shade. No other excuse was needed to Bardo and Romola than saying simply that he had been unexpectedly hindered; he felt confident their proud delicacy would inquire no farther. He lost no time in getting to Ognissanti, and hastily taking some food there, he crossed the Arno by the Ponte alia Carraja, and made his way as directly as possible towards the Via de’ Bardi.. . But it was the hour when all the world who meant to be in particularly good time to see the Corso were returning from the Borghi, or villages just outside the gates, where they had dined and reposed themselves; and the thoroughfares leading to the bridges were of course the issues towards which the stream of sightseers tended. Just as Tito reached the Ponte Vecchio and the entrance of the Via de’ Bardi, he was suddenly urged back towards the angle of the intersecting streets. A company on horseback, coming from the Via Guicciardini, and turning up the Via de’ Bardi, had compelled the foot-passengers to recede hurriedly. Tito had been walking, as his manner was, with the thumb of his right-hand resting in his belt; and as he was thus forced to pause, and was looking carelessly at the passing cavaliers, he felt a very thin cold hand laid on his. He started round, and saw the Dominican friar whose upturned face had so struck him in the morning. Seen closer, the face looked more evidently worn by sickness and not by age; and again it brought some strong but indefinite reminiscences to Tito.. . “Pardon me, but—from your face and your ring,”—said the friar,. . in a faint voice, “is not your name Titomelema?”. . “Yes,” said Tito,. . also speaking faintly, doubly jarred by the cold touch and the mystery. He was not apprehensive or timid through his imagination, but through his sensations and perceptions he could easily be made to shrink and turn pale like a maiden.. . “Then I shall fulfil my commission.”. . The friar put his hand under his scapulary, and drawing out a small linen bag which hung round his neck, took from it a bit of parchment, doubled and stuck firmly together with some black adhesive substance, and placed it in Tito’s hand. On the outside was written in Italian, in a small but distinct character—. . “Tito Melema, aged twenty-three, with a dark, beautiful face, long dark curls, the brightest smile, and a large onyx ring on his right forefinger.”. . Tito did not look at the friar, but tremblingly broke open the bit of parchment. Inside, the words were—. . “I am sold for a slave: I think they are going to take me to Antioch. The gems alone will serve to ransom me.”. . Tito looked round at the friar, but could only ask a question with his eyes.. . “I had it at Corinth,” the friar said,. . speaking with difficulty, like one whose small strength had been overtaxed. . “I had it from a man who was dying.”. . “He is dead, then?” said Tito,. . with a bounding of the heart.. . “Not the writer. The man who gave it me was a pilgrim, like myself, to whom the writer had intrusted it, because he was journeying to Italy.”. . “You know the contents?”. . “I do not know them, but I conjecture them. Your friend is in slavery: you will go and release him. But I am unable to talk now.”. . The friar, whose voice had become feebler and feebler, sank down on the stone bench against the wall from which he had risen to touch Tito’s hand, adding—. . “I am at San Marco; my name is Fra Luca.”Embed',\n '84 ContributorsBreathe Lyrics[PIRAGUA GUY].

So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?. “Hey, I’m home?”. [WOMAN]. Mira, Nina. . [NINA]. Hey. [COMPANY]. No me preocupo por ella. . [NINA]. They’re not worried about me. . [COMPANY]. Mira, allí esta nuestra estrella. . [NINA]. They are all counting on me to succeed. . [COMPANY]. Ella sí da la talla. . [NINA (COMPANY)]. I am the one who made it out (Ah). The one who always made the grade. But maybe I should have just stayed home (Mira, Nina). When I was a child I stayed wide awake. Climbed to the highest place. On every fire escape. Restless to climb (Respira). I got every scholarship. Saved every dollar. The first to go to college. How do I tell them why (Respira). I’m coming back home? (Ah). With my eyes on the horizon. Just me and the GWB. Asking, “Gee, Nina, what’ll you be?\". Straighten the spine, smile for the neighbors. Everything’s fine, everything’s cool. The standard reply, “Lots of tests, lots of papers\". Smile, wave goodbye and pray to the sky, oh, god. And what will my parents say?. . [COMPANY]. Nina. . [NINA]. Can I go in there and say…. . [COMPANY]. Nina. . [NINA]. “I know that I’m letting you down?”. . [ABUELA CLAUDIA]. Nina. . [NINA]. Just breathe14Embed',\n \"211 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguêsPolskiItalianoDeutsch...Ready for It?

Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though. Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so. I see nothing better, I keep him forever. Like a vendetta-ta. . [Pre-Chorus].

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me. Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry. But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and. We'll move to an island, and. And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor. Every love I've known in comparison is a failure. I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now. Never be the same now, now.

She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee. Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me. Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit. Streets talkin\\', they\\'ll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit. Stay keepin\\' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax. Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts. Yes, Lord. . [Chorus: Drake]. Yeah, I say fuck you, \\'less I’m with ya.

Bring \\'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring. Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend. I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!). YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin\\'. Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby. Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy. . [Chorus: Drake].

I'ma get a scholarship to King's College. I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish. The problem is I got a lot of brains, but no polish. I gotta holler just to be heard. With every word, I drop knowledge. I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal. Tryin' to reach my goal, my power of speech unimpeachable. Only nineteen, but my mind is older. These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder. Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage. I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish. I walk these streets famished. The plan is to fan this spark into a flame. But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name. I am the—. . [HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]. A-L-E-X-A-N-D. E-R—we are—meant to be.

Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree. He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free. So there will be a revolution in this century. Enter me. . [LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS].

I think your pants look hot. Laurens, I like you a lot. Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot. What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot. Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not. A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?. Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is. . Oh, am I talkin' too loud?. Sometimes I get overexcited, shoot off at the mouth. I never had a group of friends before. I promise that I'll make y'all proud. . [LAURENS]. Let's get this guy in front of a crowd. .

Is it like a beat without a melody?. See, I never thought I'd live past twenty. Where I come from, some get half as many. Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask. We have to make this moment last, that's plenty. Scratch that. This is not a moment, it's the movement. Where all the hungriest brothers with. Something to prove went?. Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand. We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land. And? If we win our independence?. Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?. Or will the blood we shed begin an endless. Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?. I know the action in the street is excitin'. But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n' fightin'. I've been readin' 'n' writin'. We need to handle our financial situation. Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?. I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately smashin' every expectation. Every action's an act of creation. I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow. For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow. .

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits. She craves attention, she praises an image. She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor. Oh, she don\\'t see the light that\\'s shinin\\'. Deeper than the eyes can find it. Maybe we have made her blind. So she tries to cover up her pain. And cut her woes away. \\'Cause covergirls don\\'t cry. After their face is made. . [Chorus]. And there\\'s a hope that\\'s waiting for you in the dark. You should know you\\'re beautiful just the way you are. And you don\\'t have to change a thing, the world could change its heart. No scars to your beautiful, we\\'re stars and we\\'re beautiful. Oh, oh, oh. Oh-oh, oh, oh. And you don\\'t have to change a thing. The world could change its heart. No scars to your beautiful, we\\'re stars and we\\'re beautiful. . [Verse 2]. She has dreams to be an envy, so she\\'s. Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothing. She says, \"Beauty is pain and there\\'s beauty in everything, what\\'s a little bit of hunger?\". \"I can go a little while longer,\" she fades away. She don\\'t see her perfect, she don\\'t understand she\\'s worth it. Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh. So to all the girls that\\'s hurting, let me be your mirror. Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within. You might also like[Chorus]. And there\\'s a hope that\\'s waiting for you in the dark.

Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;. And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,. Forever flushing round a summer sky.\". - Castle of Indolence. In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.. . I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.. . From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a high German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.. . The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.. . Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.. . It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.. . I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.. . In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, \"tarried,\" in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.. . His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out,—an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils\\' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer\\'s day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, \"Spare the rod and spoil the child.\" Ichabod Crane\\'s scholars certainly were not spoiled.. I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called \"doing his duty by their parents;\" and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that \"he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.\". . When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.. . That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.. . In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated \"by hook and by crook,\" the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.. . The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.. . From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather\\'s \"History of New England Witchcraft,\" in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.. . He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old Mather\\'s direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,—the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch\\'s token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, \"in linked sweetness long drawn out,\" floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.. . Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!. . But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings!. . All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was—a woman.. . Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father\\'s peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.. . Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,—sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.. . The pedagogue\\'s mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind\\'s eye, he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.. As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee,—or the Lord knows where!. . When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.. . From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.. . Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox\\'s tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \"Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!\" The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.. . This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel\\'s paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, \"sparking,\" within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.. . Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack—yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away—jerk!—he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.. . To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover\\'s eloquence.. . I profess not to know how women\\'s hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.. . Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,—by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would \"double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse;\" and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod\\'s, to instruct her in psalmody.. . In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or \"quilting frolic,\" to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel\\'s; and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.. . All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.. . The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master\\'s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.. . Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers\\'; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.. It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.. . The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.. . As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.. . Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and \"sugared suppositions,\" he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.. . It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.. . Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.. . Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel\\'s mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the tender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes. And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst—Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.. . He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men\\'s do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he\\'d turn his back upon the old schoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!. . Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to \"fall to, and help themselves.\". . And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.. . Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.. . When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war.. . This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.. . There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.. . But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.. . The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel\\'s, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.. . The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.. . This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.. . All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.. . The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away,—and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a tête-à-tête with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen. Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival? Heaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady\\'s heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.. . It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills—but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.. . All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate André, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major André\\'s tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.. . As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan—his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.. . About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley\\'s Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.. . As he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.. . The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, \"Who are you?\" He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.. . Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,—the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!—but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod\\'s flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse\\'s head, in the eagerness of his flight.. . They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.. . As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase, but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper\\'s wrath passed across his mind,—for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse\\'s backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.. . An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones\\'s ghostly competitor had disappeared. \"If I can but reach that bridge,\" thought Ichabod, \"I am safe.\" Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash,—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.. . The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master\\'s gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses\\' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.. . The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog\\'s-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather\\'s \"History of Witchcraft,\" a \"New England Almanac,\" and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his children no more to school, observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter\\'s pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.. . The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody\\'s debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him; the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his stead.. . It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered; written for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival\\'s disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.. The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond. The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.. . [Postscript]. Found in the handwriting of Mr. Knickerbocker.. . The preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face, and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor--he made such efforts to be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove?. . The story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove--. . \"That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it:. . \"That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it.. . \"Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.\". . The cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well, but still he thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one or two points on which he had his doubts.. . \"Faith, sir,\" replied the story-teller, \"as to that matter, I don\\'t believe one-half of it myself.\" D.

The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much. If I gotta be frank about it. Ain\\'t worth the stress. First the text, then the draws, see first is sex. Then it\\'s calls cause the bird\\'s obsessed. Want flowers, cards, and the purses next. Nah, bitch can\\'t get a dollar. Cole on Twitter, bitch can\\'t get a follow.

You know when you\\'re doing a song about a small town. You gotta start it with a cliché, you know what I\\'m sayin\\'?. Like.... . [Verse 1: Suffa]. Time moves a little slower here. The paint peels, \\'cause the summers here are so severe. And we\\'re nowhere near nowhere you would know of. Locals here ride, they show up just to show off. Old men take a load off, just to watch the day go by. Philosophising with their friends like they\\'re Plato. They prophecise on the bench by the main road, right. They got advice; I’m like \\'Ayo, if you say so, guys\\'. But what do they know? Fox News got \\'em lit. They’re shook, \\'cause fundamentalist the new communist. Old girl with her shopping list clutch her handbag close. I’m like \\'Damn, ma\\'am; Dan, this old bag has jokes\\'. \\'Cause I\\'m a gentleman, but then again, most of us are.

You got a fast car. I want a ticket to anywhere. Maybe we make a deal. Maybe together we can get somewhere. Any place is better. Starting from zero, got nothing to lose. Maybe we\\'ll make something. Me, myself, I got nothing to prove. . [Verse 2]. You got a fast car. I got a plan to get us outta here. I been working at the convenience store. Managed to save just a little bit of money. Won\\'t have to drive too far. Just \\'cross the border and into the city. You and I can both get jobs. Finally see what it means to be living. . [Verse 3]. See, my old man\\'s got a problem. He lives with a bottle, that\\'s the way it is. He says his body\\'s too old for working. His body\\'s too young to look like his. When mama went off and left him. She wanted more from life than he could give. I said, \"Somebody\\'s gotta take care of him\". So I quit school and that\\'s what I did. You might also like[Refrain]. You got a fast car.

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone. . [Verse 4]. You got a fast car. We go cruising, entertain ourselves. You still ain\\'t got a job. And I work in a market as a checkout girl. I know things will get better. You\\'ll find work and I\\'ll get promoted. We\\'ll move out of the shelter. Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs. . [Chorus]. So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car. Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk. City lights lay out before us. And your arm felt nice wrapped \\'round my shoulder. And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged. I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone. [Verse 5]. You got a fast car. I got a job that pays all our bills. You stay out drinkin\\' late at the bar. See more of your friends than you do of your kids. I\\'d always hoped for better. Thought maybe together, you and me\\'d find it. I got no plans, I ain\\'t going nowhere. So take your fast car and keep on driving. . [Chorus]. So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car. Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk.

They don't give a damn how a nigga been. All they wanna know is what I got to give. How much did I spend? What I got to lend?. What I did and what I didn't do for them. Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim. Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym. Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten. Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in. Askin' what I cop, none of your concern. One day you gone learn what you tryna get. Everything on sale, goin' out of biz. Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids.

You just high yella, you not that important. Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet. Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water. Conversation cost a lot of chips.

Gun pop, one shot\\'ll make your lungs drop, Chess. All my niggas get it in, I\\'m from a dumb block, chess. Mortal Kombat, finish him; Kung Lao, yes. I ain\\'t come here for play, I ain\\'t come her for chatter. 4 pound to the gut, put blood in ya bladder. All them niggas that you claim, when I aim. They gon\\' scatter, knock the gigs out your brain. Leave the streets full of data. Ladder hangin\\' out the bottom so you know what this .40 hold. I\\'ll drag yo\\' bitch ass from White plains to Fordham Road. Cause if my young niggas from Edenwald, see you and give me a call. You\\'re gettin\\' stripped down to your socks cause we need it all!. Now, what is chess? A game with 16 pieces, 1 king, 1 Queen. 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops and 8 pawns. So, I should hit your crib with this .16. Kill the Queen and King, merc you and your rooks at 2 at night. Like I\\'m Bishop wit this .8 long!. I got the Juice now, I mean you rap \\'bout this killa shit. Well, pop out the proof now! Suck your faggot ass teeth again. I\\'ll knock out a tooth now! Philly rap made you niggas. Before SMACK made it commercial and more calmer. I been had a fridge full of rappers like Jeffery Dahmer!. Scream \"Allahu Akbar\", crash your building like a bomber!. Stay with a crew of wild niggas who love to spark beef. They kill cats, fish, dogs, shit, pretty much anything with a heart beat. You guppies lucky, you never felt the wrath of the shark teeth!. Come to my block, Discovery Channel, it\\'s Shark Week!. Aw sheesh, this AA-12 will squash beef, cause grief. Mama kissing your corpse; on ya hard cheeks!. Toss reefs in your grave, pussy nigga, rest in peace. Another young nigga that died for false reppin\\' these streets. And, all the critics say he\\'s hard, but I don\\'t see that shit. I got niggas that\\'s doing life, we don\\'t believe that shit. You\\'re talking wild beef, shorty, you canal street. Won\\'t sell me that shit! Haha!. I said, Marine pistol, let the sub-machine hit you. .223\\'s, it\\'s gonna feel like submarine hit you!. K got the Woodstock, A got a good shot. Brains hang, get your fuckin\\' name on a wood box!. This year, I\\'m murdering niggas, back to my old ways. In the trap, same Dickie on, 3-4 days. War with us, that\\'s somethin\\' that you don\\'t wanna go through. The judge shoot a fireball out, like GoKu. Bullets hittin\\' brick walls, trust me, it\\'ll go through. You don\\'t know the shooters, but nigga, the shooters know YOU. My pops was a Gun, I\\'m the son of a \"G\". You\\'re pops was a bug, you\\'se the son of a Flea. Your mom\\'s is a bitch, you\\'se the son of a \"B\". I\\'ll send a spirit to the sun if nigga\\'s want it wit\\' Reed. Time. You might also like[Verse 1: Chess]. I finally got somebody I gotta body. I\\'m straight out the gate like God denied me. I told myself \"Reed, gotta walk in dead\". And all it take is a head shot to drop a zombie. But, I was only have motivated. Then, I received dollars for Dollaz homi. So I had to spice it up for the chips, like the hottest Taci\\'s. This my shit, you don\\'t wanna see me. Try and stop me, when I tell him \"Do something\". I don\\'t mean find a hobby. You fin\\' to get a worse ass whooping that you got from Johnny. I don\\'t believe none of them words, don\\'t even try to try me. Get beat and boxed for story telling raps; Lodi Dodi. Nigga, this ratchet ring like if you wife a thottie. That was some bars from Chess. Was it my hardest? Yes, got him!. Is he Reed Dollaz, Reed dead or Reed done?. If we squeeze ours, he\\'ll see lead from each one. He done walked into reality. But a head tap will make his dreams run!. Down his mind, literally, sovereignty. I came back to land left this King dumb (kingdom)!. See, I\\'ma fuck Reed up, no damn debating. The hammers blazing, one gotta beam, one gotta scope. 2 different views like fans debating. Or I could I stop Reed, to give him a quick right (write) like annotations. Beware of what this man creating. Cause I don\\'t train to get slept on, I\\'m not a homeless man in stations. Last Christmas, I got a gift of picking up trash; sanitation. Your era done, you can\\'t stand with greatness. Only way you can hang with this roster (rasta). Is if your man\\'s Jamaican. These bald heads sick, that\\'s a clip full of cancer patients. And a I gotta chopper arm like it was amputated. If he sees the .4 he\\'s gonna dip like he ran from Jason. Or, a different weapon is popping, Hecklers behind him. Like his man\\'s was hating. Wait, why was your man\\'s just hating?. You ain\\'t nobody nigga, your family\\'s famous. Well, not no more but in 200 B.C., this man was blazin\\'. But, now this man is ancient and he dealing with a savage aak. Plus, all my raps is hot, get in his space. And leave Earth more often than astronauts. This finna to be more dreadful than Rich Gang, Migos, Future. Travis Scott. Lil Wayne, Lauryn, Bob Marley, whoever else have the locks. Tay running, his dame comin\\'. They still ain\\'t trying to pass the Roc(k). Fuck it, this a scrimmage, watch the basket drop. Leave this bastard\\'s top wide open. But I\\'m the nigga who had the shot!. Hurt your boy with a .30 toy, a nasty Glock. Hope it don\\'t jam on me when I have to pop. Cause the gun funny, it\\'s a laughing stock!. Some think I force aggression, but it ain\\'t false aggression. Nigga, I\\'m raw by mistake like the Magnum popped!. Get picked from the .30 like last drafting spots!. Now, that was hot! And ya\\'ll really think Reed Dollaz ready?. Nigga, this chopper deadly, *makes chopping noise*. Sounds like a professional chef chopping veggies. I\\'ll kick in his stomach, now everything on my feet is guts. Like a baby inside his belly. Or I\\'ll cock the Desi, baow his brains look like Hot spaghetti. The pasta ready!. Face cut for the work, over weight, give him surgery. Like his doctor heavy. But that\\'s light, I can Cave in it-. I took a shot at Roc already. Think about it. Where Jimmy at? I\\'m trying to see if the shooter and driver ready. What we gonna talk? Fuck that, Suge got machetes. He don\\'t get the pumps, this Shotgun, getting sawed off!. Or, arms raise like let me speak, heart burn; Chess keep heat. Gun in his mouth, let him eat the burner. Like giving oral sex to a bitch with STD!. I took a life and I\\'ll take a second like, \"Let me think.\". The .4 is high, hit his pupil, the shot? \\'Fore his eye. He got shot before his eyes, I ain\\'t let Reed blink. Cakes up! Wait, fuck! Let\\'s bring the bars back. Let me guess, you couldn\\'t bring it in here?. It\\'s in the car, scrap? SMACK. We can take this battle to wherever the fuck he parked at!. \"It\\'s young Reed, Philly boom, I really prove\". Nigga, your gat what? You better back down fore\\' I back out. Cause, I don\\'t take shit like I\\'m backed up. So, back up or we jumping jack, and leaving him like a jumping jack. Clapped up!. He think he at the top of food chain. Til\\' fool chain get snatched up. You said you\\'ll fuck John John and called him moist?. That\\'s mad sus\\', that\\'s what you do dawg?. Let me move, ya\\'ll. Cause John John the type of nigga I\\'ll make a move on. John John the type of nigga you\\'ll make a move on. But fuck fighting, if he move wrong, we ain\\'t fightin\\'. I\\'ma shoot dawg, ya\\'ll ain\\'t catch it?. That\\'s one of his moves, dawg. I was straight to the hammer, we don\\'t do paws, nigga. You trash and you\\'re a bitch, that\\'s two flaws. For telling a couple stories, I\\'ll knock him down two floors. Busted head, broken knee and a tooth loss. He won\\'t get two fl- BRONX!. [Verse 2: Reed Dollaz]. I said, Cake Life, right? That\\'s what you claim?. That\\'s what you stand by? Word?. Well, I think all ya\\'ll are bitches, pussy niggas need a tampon. This battle is war, you done stepped into a land mine. Yeah we both throwing them punches, but I land mine!. Shotty hit the floor, make the ceiling drop. Buckshot pellets make a nigga milly rock. I\\'m from the era where you had to be really hot. When you can only rap about guns that you REALLY shot. Nowadays, niggas lyin\\' on they Shmurda Gang. Making up guns, I ain\\'t never heard the name. Stop lyin\\' nigga, you ain\\'t never serve the \\'cane. You had an after school job, talking crack, you the Burger King. Don\\'t make me drive through, cock it, put the wop it to you. Yao Ming with the thing, shoot a Rocket through you. Big dog in the game, you a pocket poodle. Heard you was the plug lil nigga, I\\'ll sock it to you!. I knew niggas was gonna bring up that in the car/John John shit. But before John John evolved, I was in John John\\'s picks. On interviews they asked who inspired, I was on John John\\'s list. That\\'s why I never believe a bar that came out of John John\\'s lips. Dwight Howard how I hug the block, rap Gods. We\\'re the juggernauts, gun but you, give your jug a knot!. Nigga\\'s is sick, you think the God won\\'t bless you. This .4 pound will drop 9 on you like Van Exel, the blam stretch you. I\\'ll pop it if you get too close or put the 7 on his chest. Like I shot Kukoč. I\\'m too dope, too real for this URL/Smack shit. Cause I be out in Philly in the trenches with the trap shit. .57, FN plastic, all black shit. A handgun with .223\\'s; that\\'s tragic!. Laser on it, no need for aim, I just go off beam. Top open, his top smoking, that\\'s how you blow off Steams!. Don\\'t make me hit your crib tweekin\\' wit\\' the trey pound out. Give you a pound out this trey to catch a Greyhound out. You fabricated and animated, your life a foosie. You kill niggas in bars, not wit\\' a knife or Uzi. We catch ya bitch in Co-op my youngin\\' light a doobie. Wes Craven when I\\'m wavin\\' the Wesson don\\'t make me write a movie. I had them hitters, by the door by the peep hole waitin\\'. Clip full of bald heads like chemo patients. We killin\\' everything, dawg you won\\'t leave no statements. Even though I got a lawyer that\\'ll beat those cases. Sick of these fake fucks, \\'bout to get they wings plucked. Faggot ass niggas runnin\\' \\'round screamin\\', \"Cakes up.\". Dawg, where I\\'m from, that\\'s some homo shit. Cause when her cakes up, it\\'s bouncin\\' on my pogo stick. See this fo\\'fo\\' got a kick like a dojo flick. And we don\\'t see no, hear no, don\\'t know shit. I was about to hit y\\'all wit\\' this rap god scheme. But instead I\\'ma give y\\'all the definition of what a rap god mean. Y\\'all ready? Y\\'all ready?. It means I birthed and fathered you niggas right from the very start. I mean I died and bled for you niggas, I got a heavy heart. Losin\\' ya faith in the god is not very smart. Not I\\'m back to fuck up the globe and I talkin\\' every part. First stop, right to NY, straight to the Bronx wit\\' it. Right to Chess door, bow down, nigga this god given. Snatch Rex up by the collar, nigga y\\'all all seen it. Doomsday o\\'clock {crowd is too fucking loud to hear the rest}. [Round 2: Chess]. Round one, y\\'all think I was playin\\'?. Round two I\\'m finna tweak out insane. I aim and take this G out his game. Leave Reed red, a stomach shot will knock an E out his name. Game, I amaze the crowd on fuckin\\' sight. Frosty the Snowman, watch a cold, three round body come to life. Yikes. Bein\\' gentle in bed, I\\'m fuckin\\' nice. Reed, do what\\'s fuckin\\' right. Put on for ya team, ya town...the Philly niggas doin\\' fuckin\\' life. Better pray for ya dawg Aak. This Philly nigga gonna get more bars than bricks of raw got. If it\\'s war, then it\\'s war Aak. Sharp shooters on the beach, get him sniped by the ocean, this a sure (shore) shot. Chin check him, get every nigga jaw dropped like they all shocked. Since you already losin\\' here, I\\'ll put a round to your top like a bald spot. And if he talk hot, I stretch niggas, then put him back in place. Like, \"Do your warm up then get in ya floor spot\". I bet he\\'s an informer, snitchin\\' and givin\\' the law drops. Niggas drive by he the type to call cops. And put the pigs onto the plates, like pork chop boys stop. So you a fuckin\\' bitch and you a fuckin\\' snitch?. And y\\'all thought he was beatin\\' me? This nigga double lit. You don\\'t wanna spit raps? Twin MAC\\'s, I get it double lit. S-s-s-s-s-Smack, I ain\\'t tryin\\' to copy respect, I\\'m tryin\\' to double it. Fuck ya clique, boy I\\'ll chop ya legs off for tellin\\' me who runnin\\' wit. Nigga you wanna flip? Go call your connect then cut a brick. Or bag up a zip, cause I\\'m not the one you want it wit\\'. Half the shit he say, don\\'t make fuckin\\' sense. His words, off track...so why he run his lips?. Just because you came prepared don\\'t mean you gonna win. The handshake after this battle, don\\'t mean we fuckin\\' friends. You in your bag? I\\'m in my fuckin\\' bin. Spend dollars on Dollaz, I\\'ll put a check up on him like a worried friend. The old slammy, just like Reed, it got a rusty pin (pen). Before I leave the crib I stuff the Glock, females workin\\' out her muffin\\' top. I dip after I tuck it in. It\\'s still \"Fuck NWX\", Shine I scream blood again. And that lil\\' church nigga Saga just make me wanna sin. He wanna be closer to God-BLAOW, lucky him. Shut up nigga, let me watch my language, you an F\\'in\\' nerd. Hittin\\' me up for a battle, you got some F\\'in\\' nerve. I\\'ll talk to you to give you my style. Cause after God speak, you supposed to spread the word. Reed chill, I\\'ll be back to you in a second bird. You told Chilla since he the King Pen, he gettin\\' drugged. Lord, that\\'s how I know you ain\\'t seasoned. Cause I\\'m waitin\\' for Chilla Jones to give me a reason. To leave him, bleedin\\'. We can do it now, fuck the Prep, we both beat him. This nigga boastin\\' about Boston? Shesh, this nigga beastin\\'. Cause my niggas from Boston told me he a weak bitch, G shit. Type to get rocked dead in his mouth for speakin\\'. Get drugged lord, run in ya trap don\\'t [?] with King Pen. I\\'m the truth and I get any nigga that lie buried. This his last battle, it\\'s quiet, I\\'m puttin\\' Reed (read) on the shelf like libraries. I\\'m very, upset we didn\\'t use a [?] problem. If I lose patience (patients), he gotta find a doctor. Loud ratchet, with a lil\\' one on the side that\\'s baby mama drama. Rip ya daddy\\'s spinal cord, baby from Dinosaur I\\'ll knock the [?]. How he gon\\' deal wit\\' me? I done killed for free. I had a passion for this before I clocked dollars. I ain\\'t one of them niggas that did this just for a buzz. I\\'m just addicted to rappin\\', B. You ever seen Faculty?. Well he knows the pen is a drug. When he gets rich, I bet he prolly spend all his money on the best whips. But when bread\\'s involved you gotta use intelligence dough. So I be coppin\\' a regular car for detectives. Speakin\\' of detectives, check this. Like listenin\\' to somebody insult you. Keep hittin\\' him up like, \"I really need somebody to talk to.\". I be finna to take back like sore loser takin\\' the wrong move. I still know grimy niggas with loaded tools. Whatever they couldn\\'t afford to text (TEC) book like poor students. Palmin\\' heat, takin\\' away from all fools for more food. Cause they gotta eat, I ain\\'t sayin\\' that robbin\\' is all cool. But think ahead, they called Rex cause it\\'s either you suck or rule (oral). Time. . [Round 3: Reed Dollaz]. I said, this ain\\'t ya average Smack rap. This that, nigga I\\'m back, now front and get smacked rap. Put the K over the shoulder, couple clips in the knapsack. Pop 30 and let the stock drop like NASDAQ. This ain\\'t even a battle no more this real and fake. And since it is, I already won but niggas still debate. That .44 Mag will have the cops on a [?]. Cause the shot broke every bone in his skull, they couldn\\'t tag a face. The first 48 we let the first 40 quake. Then ask his mom to help carry the casket at shorty wake.

Real niggas gon\\' love it, pussy niggas gon\\' stay quiet so fuck it. Six rings on like I\\'m MJ. All off the block like Dikembe. Kept a new whip like Kinte. Ballin\\' on these new niggas, pink hat where the brim lay. Try to count me out, how dare niggas?. Fourth quarter tongue out, scare niggas. Check the stats, how the fuck you compare. Niggas ballin\\' on niggas since Jordan had Air nigga. Throwback jersey and some 1\\'s on. One false move then the gun\\'s drawn.

I wasn\\'t big on attention, I ain\\'t fiend to be seen in public. And yeah I gained a lil\\' fame in this game but that wasn\\'t the biggest reason of it. Started battlin\\' cause I needed niggas to black on. Like back home I knew this little girl, she was mad strong. Grew up in the poor house, her family did her mad wrong. She used to cut her body and cry herself to sleep to them sad songs. Her mother was an addict on smack, that her step pops used to smack on. He took the EBT card til the stamps and the cash gone. She had to steal outta stores just for somethin\\' to snack on. And even when her mom made food she had to use the same spoon that her mother put the smack on. Shit was rougher than shorty hair. Shit, if she was still around I would\\'ve brought shorty here. Just to show her somethin\\' different from the wars and tears. And all affairs gave her step pops a head shot cause she lost it there. Watched that man go after hittin\\' that apple, it ain\\'t as peachy as it all appears (a pears). 39 wit\\' a birthday comin\\', the .40 near. Nicest to the trashiest, I\\'ma make \\'em all aware. It\\'s like my girl sad and I\\'m always there. I\\'m wipin\\' out all the tears (tiers). I\\'m all types of savage. When I ain\\'t have money for a chain, I had guys to snatch it. Pelle Pelle, if he wanted the icey jacket (ice he\\'d jack it). My nation got no chill you can\\'t stop my movement like I\\'m hyperactive. Get bad luck seat in the fire, that\\'s white lighter habits. I ain\\'t even wiggin\\' yet. I can raise spirits blacker than human form like a silouhette. Put this baby to sleep, my animals on his head like a pillow pet. This nigga knows I\\'m his biggest threat. But my slip ups will cause him to get shot if I keep chokin\\' I\\'m grippin\\' necks. Gettin\\' dirty wit\\' a sweet 16, like a B-Day girl in a shitty dress. Get him bum rushed, drugged and boxed like a homeless man on crystal meth. Get napped in here, black fist or the metal nigga, pick ya death. You \\'bout it, \\'bout it, nigga kill that. Play fightin\\', you ain\\'t real scrap. T.I. beanies, the hollow TIP\\'ll tilt hats. Steel clap. \"Bro that nigga dead\", I still clap. So the spirit that\\'s leavin\\' his body can feel that. Real rap, I ain\\'t kiddin\\' witchu homie. When I\\'m toastin\\' the cig\\' (Sig) at him, I ain\\'t givin\\' him a bogey. Put a round to his head, two dots plus a cut, looks like a serious emoji. I don\\'t miss shots, I\\'m hittin\\' niggas homie. If I Set It Off, one ratchet busts. Cause the only bitch to get away was Stony. When it was our time to shine we had to take risks (wrists). And I\\'ll fuck around and get him for his Rollie. Nigga you don\\'t know me. Difference between us? You had yours in the car dawg. Nah, that\\'s realistic, real shit.

That chopper in the street you better guard yours. Hear that Big Poppa in the field, that was Hard Ball (boy). That shit came from miles away, and he ain\\'t get the picture.

I guess right now you've got the last laugh. . [Verse 1]. I'm sorry if I seem uninterested. Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent. Truly I ain't got no business here. But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it. But really, I would rather be at home all by myself. Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being. I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend. So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party. I'll be here, somewhere in the corner. Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'. I can hardly hear. Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you. So, tell my friends that I'll be over here. . [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here. You might also like[Verse 2]. Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this. An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this. And I know you mean only the best. And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be. Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to. Some music with a message, like we usually do. And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet. So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here. Not there in the kitchen. With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends. So, tell them I'll be here. Right next to the boy who's throwin' up. 'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more. Oh God, why am I here?. . [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here. And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here. [Bridge]. Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator. Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none. How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this. So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done. I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'. And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way. So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready. And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low. Yo, I'll be over here. [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here.

Everybody here is watching you. 'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true. But if by chance you're here alone. Can I have a moment before I go?. 'Cause I've been by myself all night long. Hoping you're someone I used to know. . [Pre-Chorus]. You look like a movie. You sound like a song. My God, this reminds me. Of when we were young. . [Chorus]. Let me photograph you in this light. In case it is the last time that we might. Be exactly like we were before we realised. We were sad of getting old, it made us restless. It was just like a movie. It was just like a song. . [Verse 2]. I was so scared to face my fears. Nobody told me that you'd be here. And I swear you'd moved overseas. That's what you said when you left me. See Adele LiveGet tickets as low as $625You might also like[Pre-Chorus]. You still look like a movie. You still sound like a song. My God, this reminds me.

Argued and Submitted Feb. 6, 1981.Decided Oct. 19, 1981.Rehearing and Rehearing In Banc Denied Jan. 12, 1982. Stephen A. Kroft (on brief), John G. Davies and Sondra E. Beechim Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman, Beverly Hills, Cal., argued, for Universal Studios and Walt Disney.. Dean C. Dunlavey, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Los Angeles, Cal., for Sony, Sony America, Doyle, Dane, Bembach.. Appeal from the United States District Court Central District of California.. Before KILKENNY and CANBY, Circuit Judges, and EAST, District Judge.*. KILKENNY, Circuit Judge:. 1Appellants, Universal City Studios, Inc. (Universal) and Walt Disney Productions (Disney), producers and copyright owners of audiovisual materials, some of which they choose to telecast over the public airwaves, brought this copyright infringement claim against Sony Corporation (Sony), the manufacturer of the Betamax, a videotape recorder (VTR), and Betamax tapes, Sony Corporation of America (Sonam) (the American distributor of the Betamax), four retail establishments that sell the Betamax, Doyle Dane Bernbach, Inc. (DDBI) (the advertising agency retained by Sonam to promote the Betamax), and one individual (William Griffiths), who is an owner and user of the Betamax.. 2Appellants argue that home video recording of their copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement and that the corporate defendants are liable as direct, contributory and/or vicarious infringers. Additionally, appellants contend that the retail defendants violated the copyright laws when they recorded portions of appellants\\' programs to demonstrate the Betamax to a prospective purchaser. Likewise, appellants presented additional claims arising under state law and sought broad injunctive relief, as well as profits and damages. The district court, after three years of litigation and a five week nonjury trial, in the reported case of Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of America, 480 F.Supp. 429 (C.D.Cal.1979), entered judgment for appellees and held:. 3(1) that copyright holders of audiovisual materials, some of which are sold for telecast over public airwaves, did not have monopoly power over off-the-air copying of those materials by owners of a videotape recorder in their homes for private, non-commercial use;. 4(2) the retailer did not infringe upon the copyrights where it did not compete with nor profit from materials and intended only to demonstrate the recorder;. 5(3) even if home-use copyrighting constituted an infringement, neither manufacturers, distributors, retailers, nor advertisers were liable under theories of direct or contributory infringement, or vicarious liability;. 6(4) that even if the appellees were deemed liable, injunctive relief was not available where they did not unfairly compete with owners of copyrighted materials, nor interfere with their advantageous business relations.. 7. FACTUAL BACKGROUND. 8The district court in its elaborate, painstaking, and thoughtful opinion, Universal City Studios v. Sony Corp. of America, supra, at 432, 442, carefully outlined the facts and the parties\\' contentions. In our view it would be a complete waste of judicial time and effort and of no benefit to the Bench or Bar to here repeat those facts and contentions.. 9. ISSUES. 10I. Does off-the-air copying of copyrighted audiovisual materials by owners of a videotape recorder in their homes for private noncommercial use constitute an infringement?. 11II. Are the corporate appellees liable for infringement under any of the theories advanced?. 12III. If appellants are entitled to prevail, the nature of the relief to be granted.. 13IV. Retail store use of the copyrighted material.. 14V. Unfair competition claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) and state law.. 15Our comments under this issue include:. 16(a) whether the district court committed error in finding an implied video recording exception in the applicable legislation, and. 17(b) whether home video recording constitutes fair use.. 18Article I, § 8, cl. 8 of the United States Constitution empowers the Congress: \"To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing, for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" In commenting on this clause of the Constitution, our Supreme Court has said that \"The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in \\'Science and useful Arts.\\' \" Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 219, 74 S.Ct. 460, 471, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954). Despite what is said in some of the authorities that the author\\'s interest in securing an economic reward for his labors is \"a secondary consideration,\" it is clear that the real purpose of the copyright scheme is to encourage works of the intellect, and that this purpose is to be achieved by reliance on the economic incentives granted to authors and inventors by the copyright scheme. This scheme relies on the author to promote the progress of science by permitting him to control the cost of and access to his novelty. It is based on the premise that the exclusive right granted by the copyright laws \"will not impose unacceptable costs to society in terms of limiting access to published works or pricing them too high.\" The district court relied heavily on its conclusion that the Copyright Act of 1976, providing that copyright holders have monopoly power over all productions of their works, did not include reproduction of sound recordings for home use. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1), (4), (5) and 107. In arriving at this conclusion, the court compared the Copyright Act of 1909, which created the fair-use doctrine to immunize some forms of copying from the literal implications of the Act. 17 U.S.C. (1970 Ed.) § 1 with the language of 17 U.S.C. § 106 of the New Act which provides:. 19\"Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following :. 20(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;. 21(2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;. 22(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;. 23(4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; and. 24(5) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture of other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly.\" (Emphasis added.). 25\"The approach of the (statute) is to set forth the copyright owner\\'s exclusive rights in broad terms in section 106, and then to provide various limitations, qualifications, or exemptions in the 12 sections that follow. Thus, everything in section 106 is made \\'subject to sections 107 through 118,\\' and must be read in conjunction with those provisions.\" H.R. No. 94-1476, p. 61 Sept. 3, 1976, reprinted 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 5659 at 5674, 94th Congress, 2d Sess.. 26The statutory framework is unambiguous; the grant of exclusive rights is only limited by the statutory exceptions. Elementary principles of statutory construction would indicate that the judiciary should not disturb this carefully constructed statutory scheme in the absence of compelling reasons to do so. That is, we should not, absent a clear direction from Congress, disrupt this framework by carving out exceptions to the broad grant of rights apart from those in the statute itself. It is the duty of the courts to give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question. Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979); Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979); United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 96 S.Ct. 523, 46 L.Ed.2d 514 (1976); Commissioner v. Bilder, 369 U.S. 499, 82 S.Ct. 881, 8 L.Ed.2d 65 (1962); Church of Scientology of California v. U. S. Dept. of Justice, 612 F.2d 417 (C.A.9 1979).. 27Our study of the record and analysis of the legislation convinces us that the district court inadvertently bypassed the statutory framework of the 1976 legislation and, in particular, § 106 of the new Act. In commenting on the \"broad language\" of the new Act, the district court expressed the belief that despite the monopoly power over all reproductions of their works granted by § 106, nonetheless, the legislative history indicated to the contrary. We quote from its opinion:. 28. \"The broad language of the New Act suggests that copyright holders have monopoly power over all reproductions of their works. Legislative history, however, shows that Congress did not intend this broad statement to include reproductions of sound recordings for home use. The central question here is whether Congress intended the same language to give copyright holders of audiovisual works monopoly power over off-the-air recording of their works for home use. Legislative history does not show this intent.\" 480 F.Supp. at 443.. 29By characterizing its task as a search for whether Congress intended to afford protection, the district court misapprehended the scope of the relevant inquiry. The issue is not whether Congress exhibited an intent to protect a copyright holder from certain reproduction of his works. It had already expressed its intent to do so by extending the \"bundle of rights\" set forth in § 106 to copyright owners, subject to specific sections, to-wit: §§ 107-118. Consequently, our concern must be whether Congress has exhibited the intent to limit the rights of copyright owners in ways not specified in §§ 107-118. When one analyzes whether there exists an implied home video recording exception, apart from the fair use doctrine, in the light of the statutory framework, it is manifest that the district court\\'s conclusion was erroneous. While the sound recording situation is analogous, there are a number of reasons why sound recordings should receive different judicial treatment.1 The difference between these two approaches did Congress intend to afford protection or did Congress intend to withdraw protection is more than a matter of semantics.2. 30First, the copyright statute treats sound recording and audiovisual works as separate categories of protected materials.3 And Congress has shown \"special solicitude for audiovisual works.\"4 For example, audiovisual materials are specifically excluded from some exemptions by the 1976 Act. 17 U.S.C. §§ 108(h), 110(l ), 112(a). Section 108 provides strong support for the conclusion that Congress was concerned about unauthorized reproduction of audiovisual works, whether or not such reproductions were for profit. Section 108(h) excludes audiovisual works other than an audiovisual work dealing with the news from the limited exception provided by § 108. The House Report dealing with § 108(h) indicates that the doctrine of fair use may have a limited application to the reproduction of such works. House Report at 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 5692. In addition, even as to audiovisual news programs, which are subject to the § 108 exemption, the H.R. notes, in regard to § 108(f)(3), that:. 31. \"It is intended to permit libraries and archives, subject to the general conditions of this section, to make off-the-air videotape recordings of daily network newscasts for limited distribution to scholars and researchers for use in research purposes. As such, it is an adjunct to the American Television and Radio Archive established in Section 113 of the Act which will be the principal repository for television broadcast material, including news broadcasts. The inclusion of language indicating that such material may only be distributed by lending by the library or archive is intended to preclude performance, copying, or sale, whether or not for profit, by the recipient of a copy of a television broadcast taped off-the-air pursuant to this clause.\" 1976 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 5690-91.. 32In light of this caution with respect to the limited § 108 exemption, it is clear that Congress did not intend to create a blanket exemption for home video recording, even when the recording is not for a commercial purpose.. 33Second, much of the underlying rationale for the recognition of an exemption for the home recording of sound recordings is simply not applicable to videorecording. Congress, when it granted limited copyright protection to sound recordings for the first time in 1971, made it clear in the legislative history that:. 34. \"In approving the creation of a limited copyright in sound recordings it is the intention of the Committee that this limited copyright not grant any broader rights than are accorded to other copyright proprietors under the existing title 17. Specifically, it is not the intention of the Committee to restrain the home recording, from broadcasts or from tapes or records, of recorded performances, where the home recording is for private use and with no purpose of reproducing or otherwise capitalizing commercially on it. This practice is common and unrestrained today, and the record producers and performers would be in no different position from that of the owners of copyright in recorded musical compositions over the past 20 years.\" (Emphasis added.) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1971, 1566 at 1572.5. 35Beyond question that statement was not intended to apply equally to home video recording.6 Perhaps most importantly, Congress simply was not addressing the problem of home video recording. Certainly in 1971, home video recording did not present Congress with a \"common and unrestrained practice\" developed in a period when copyright protection was wholly lacking.7. 36There is no clear legislative language indicating that home video recording is not within the exclusive rights granted by § 106. The statute itself and the House and Senate Reports accompanying the 1976 Act do not provide for a broad based home use exception. There was never a considered review of the home video recording problem. The statements supporting the district court\\'s conclusion8 hardly represent when considered in the context in which they were made and in the context of the 20 year copyright revision process a firm expression of Congressional intent to carve out a major exception to the copyright scheme.. 37The legislative history of the 1971 Amendment, heavily relied upon by the district court as disclosed by its opinion, 480 F.Supp. pages 444 and 445, is entirely beside the point. It is clear that the history relied upon, H.R. No. 487, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 7, Reprinted (1971) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pages 1566, 1572, was not intended to apply equally to video home recording. We have emphasized this point in our footnote 6. Above all, it must be recognized that the Congress was in no way addressing the problem of video recording in its discussion of the 1971 legislation. Consequently, the analogy the district court attempted to draw between that legislation and the Act of 1976 is simply without foundation. There is absolutely nothing in the 1971 legislation which would indicate that the Congress was in any way concerning itself with home video recording. It is well settled that silence cannot be viewed as an expression of Congressional intent. Turpin v. Mailet, 579 F.2d 152 (C.A.2 1978), vacated, 439 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 554, 58 L.Ed.2d 645, 591 F.2d 426 (C.A.2 1979). Beyond that, where the meaning of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it would be highly improper to construe inconclusive legislative history so as to apply a statute in a manner inconsistent with its claimed meaning. United States v. Wilson, 591 F.2d 546 (C.A.9 1979).. 38Resort to the legislative history of an Act is entirely unnecessary when the statute is clear and unequivocal on its face. United States v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1278, 6 L.Ed.2d 575 (1961), rehearing denied 368 U.S. 870, 82 S.Ct. 24, 7 L.Ed.2d 70. The legislative history of a statute is not relevant when the terms of the statute are clear and unambiguous. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 507 F.2d 905 (C.A.9 1974).. 39On this issue, we conclude that off-the-air copying of copyrighted audiovisual materials by owners of videotape recorders in their own homes for private noncommercial use, constitutes an infringement of appellants\\' copyrighted audiovisual materials.. 40. FAIR USE DOCTRINE. 41As indicated by the district court, the analysis of whether the recording was infringement does not end with the statutory language. While the old Act was in effect, the courts pronounced a rule of law known as the doctrine of \"Fair Use.\" This doctrine has been appropriately described as \"the most troublesome in the whole law of copyright.\" Dellar v. Samuel Goldwyn, Inc., 104 F.2d 661 (C.A.2 1939). From its inception, the doctrine has presented members of the judiciary with among the most elusive views that the courts are called upon to decide. It has been said that the doctrine is entirely equitable and is so flexible as virtually to defy definition. Time, Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates, 293 F.Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Time after time the courts have ruled on the Fair Use doctrine, but no real definition of the concept has ever emerged. One of the better definitions is that of the Second Circuit in Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d 303, 306 (C.A.2 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1009, 87 S.Ct. 714, 17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967), where it is said that fair use is \"a privilege in others than the owners of a copyright to use the copyrighted material in a reasonable manner without his consent, notwithstanding the monopoly granted to the owner\" by the copyright. The Congress in the legislation of 1976 attempted to define fair use in § 107 which reads:. 42. \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include. 43(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;. 44(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;. 45(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and. 46(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\". 47It is noteworthy that the legislative history of § 107 makes it clear that its statements of the fair use doctrine offer some guidance to users in determining when the principles of the doctrine apply. However, it is there emphasized that the endless variety of situations and combinations of circumstances that can arise in particular cases precludes the formulation of exact rules.. 48The history states that the legislation endorses the purposes and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute. We quote from the closing sentence of the history:. 49. \"Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.\" U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, 5680.. 50Consequently, and despite what is said by the district court, this fair use analysis is equally applicable to alleged violations under both the Old and the New Act. It is interesting to note that appellees have not suggested that home video recording would not violate the Old Act in the absence of a finding of fair use.. 51Despite the nebulous character of the doctrine, previous case law and the general copyright scheme do provide us with considerable guidance. As the first sentence of § 107 indicates, fair use has traditionally involved what might be termed the \"productive use\" of copyrighted material. See 66 Va.L.Rev. at 1012-1014. The purposes listed in § 107 are simply illustrative and not limitative, but they do give some idea of the general orientation of the doctrine. It is noteworthy that the statute does not list \"convenience\" or \"entertainment\" or \"increased access\" as purposes within the general scope of fair use.. 52Leon Seltzer, in his illuminating book Exemptions and Fair Use in Copyright (1978) states:. 53. \"The list, casual or studied as it may be, reflects what in fact the subject matter of fair use has in the history of its adjudication consisted in: it has always had to do with the use by a second author of a first author\\'s work. Fair use has not heretofore had to do with the mere reproduction of a work in order to use it for its intrinsic purpose to make what might be called the \\'ordinary\\' use of it. When copies are made for the work\\'s \\'ordinary\\' purposes, ordinary infringement has customarily been triggered, not notions of fair use.\" Id. at 24. (Emphasis in original.). 54The cases have, for the most part, adhered to this aspect of the fair use doctrine. If an alleged infringer has reproduced a copyrighted work to use it for its intrinsic purpose, fair use has not generally been applied. Nimmer notes, however, that the courts have not adhered to this notion in recent years, and cites two cases as authority Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United States, 487 F.2d 1345 (Ct.Cl.1973), aff\\'d by an equally divided court, 420 U.S. 376, 95 S.Ct. 1344, 43 L.Ed.2d 264 (1975), and the district court\\'s opinion in this case. Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(A)(1) at 13-58 n. 23.3. Williams & Wilkins Co., which has been appropriately regarded as the \"Dred Scott decision of copyright law\", 487 F.2d at 1387 (Nichols, J., dissenting), is clearly not binding in this circuit, and, in any event, we find its underlying rationale singularly unpersuasive. The district court, while noting that Williams & Wilkins Co. \"has little precedential value,\" 480 F.Supp. at 450, and quoting Nimmer\\'s critique of the opinion, Id. at 451, used Williams & Wilkins Co.\\'s distortions of the fair use rationale to justify an application of the doctrine which, in our opinion, stretches fair use beyond recognition and undermines our traditional reliance on the economic incentives provided to authors by the copyright scheme.. 55In Williams & Wilkins Co., the Court of Claims found that copying by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of entire articles published in plaintiff\\'s journals was fair use. Plaintiff was the publisher of certain medical and scientific journals. The libraries regularly filled requests for journal articles (including some in plaintiff\\'s journals) by photocopying such articles. Under this system, the libraries copied approximately 200,000 articles a year. The majority identified the core of its fair use finding:. 56. \"First, plaintiff has not in our view shown, and there is inadequate reason to believe, that it is being or will be harmed substantially by these specific practices of NIH and NLM; second, we are convinced that medicine and medical research will be injured by holding these particular practices to be an infringement; and, third, since the problem of accommodating the interests of science with those of the publishers (and authors) calls fundamentally for legislative solution or guidance, which has not yet been given, we should not, during the period before congressional action is forthcoming, place such a risk of harm upon science and medicine.\" 487 F.2d at 1354.. 57We believe that Williams & Wilkins Co. is clearly distinguishable. It appears that the Court of Claims was primarily concerned about the serious damage to medical science that would result if it held for the plaintiff. In this case, there is no corresponding countervailing societal benefit to \"weigh\" against the copyright interests of the author. We do not mean to suggest that increased access to such Disney products as \"Chip and Dale/Mixed Nuts\" is not a benefit to society. We only mean to say that the consequences attendant upon reduced consumer control of access do not in any way correspond to the deleterious consequences of reduced access identified by the Court of Claims in Williams & Wilkins Co.. 58Aside from the obvious distinctions between Williams & Wilkins Co. and the instant case, we believe that the Court of Claims\\' approach in treating intrinsic use of such work as within the bounds of fair use created doctrinal confusion that raises the spectre of the evisceration of the traditional workings of the copyright scheme. As Seltzer has stated:. 59. \"The traditional fair use notion has had to do with the sort of access that the mind of a user has to a copyrighted work: the work is instantly accessible on sight or hearing, and the question is what the second user would or should be allowed to \\'do\\' with it or, more accurately, what the creator of the work ought to have expected him freely to do with it. Use for photocopying and phonorecording involves a different sort of access: the possibility and the capability of instant reproduction of the work in the same mode and for the same purpose the original was in the first place acquired. With the first sort of access and use we can deal under notions of fair use, even when it involves photocopying, for appropriate expectations of economic reward are essentially unchanged. The second kind of access and use triggers questions of reallocation of costs, however, and insofar as a use is of that sort, it is appropriately dealt with as an exemption from the normal workings of the copyright scheme, ...\" Seltzer, supra, at 37-38. (Emphasis added.). 60Seltzer concludes that exemptions from the normal workings of the copyright scheme, because they involve the reallocation of costs, are matters for Congress, not the courts.. 61We hold that, particularly in the context of new technology, there is a danger to including the sort of copying involved in Williams & Wilkins Co. within the scope of the fair use doctrine. New technology, which makes possible the mass reproduction of copyrighted material (effectively taking control of access from the author), places a strain upon the fair use doctrine. A court, if it decides that fair use is applicable, is required to weigh in \"balancing the equities\" the \"benefit\" of an extremely popular increase in access with the \"harm\" to a plaintiff. The harm to a copyright plaintiff is inherently speculative, and as Williams & Wilkins Co. and the district court decision indicate, a plaintiff is faced with the unenviable task of proving the nonexistence of fair use, which has typically been viewed as a defense.. 62The costs are also important. They fall primarily into two categories. First, the result of applying fair use to intrinsic use cases like Williams & Wilkins Co. and this case is a fundamental restructuring of the copyright system not justified by the statutory scheme or traditional notions of fair use. Second, the framework for copyright litigation this view establishes is ultimately hostile and extremely adverse to the rights of copyright holders. It places them in the unenviable position of proving damage in a context in which extreme difficulty is acknowledged.. 63As a society, we may decide that these costs are acceptable. But, that branch of public policy determination is preeminently a decision for the legislative branch.. 64It is our conviction that the fair use doctrine does not sanction home videorecording. Without a \"productive use\", i. e. when copyrighted material is reproduced for its intrinsic use, the mass copying of the sort involved in this case precludes an application of fair use. An analysis of the four factors listed in § 107 does not dictate a contrary result.. 65A consideration of the first factor \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes\" does not aid appellees\\' case. The district court noted that \"Courts have traditionally applied this factor by asking whether the copyrighted material is used for criticism, research or other independent work.\" 480 F.Supp. at 453. The fact that the use involved does not further a traditionally accepted purpose clearly weighs against a finding of fair use. The district court, however, emphasized the noncommercial9 and home use of the copyrighted material. The statute does not, however, draw a simple commercial/noncommercial distinction. The statute contrasts commercial and nonprofit educational purposes, and there is no question that the copying of entertainment works for convenience does not fall within the latter category. The fact that the \"infringing\" activity takes places in the homes does not warrant a blanket exemption from any liability. It seems more appropriate to address the privacy concerns raised by the district court in fashioning the appropriate relief. The suggestion that First Amendment concerns support the purpose of Betamax users to increase the access to copyrighted materials is wholly without merit. \"The first amendment is not a license to trammel on legally recognized rights in intellectual property.\" Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Scoreboard Posters, Inc., 600 F.2d 1184, 1188 (C.A.5 1979); Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751, 759 (C.A.9 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1132, 99 S.Ct. 1054, 59 L.Ed.2d 94 (1979); Sid & Marty Krofft Television v. McDonald\\'s Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1160-1171 (C.A.9 1977).. 66The second factor \"the nature of the copyrighted work\" does not support a finding of fair use. The legislative history and the case law dealing with this factor are rather sparse, but there seems to be some indication that the scope of fair use is greater when informational type works, as opposed to more creative products, are involved. Seltzer, supra, at 33-34; Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(A)(2) at 13-61. The courts inquire whether the nature of the material is such that additional access \"would serve the public interest in the free dissemination of information.\" Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., 366 F.2d at 307; Time, Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates, 293 F.Supp. 130, 146 (S.D.N.Y.1968). If a work is more appropriately characterized as entertainment, it is less likely that a claim of fair use will be accepted.10 The district court, however, found it significant that \"This case involves only that copyrighted material which plaintiffs voluntarily choose to have telecast over public airwaves to individual homes free of charge.\" 480 F.Supp. at 453. We fail to see how the method by which appellants have chosen to distribute their works is relevant to this factor of the fair use analysis. We are in substantial agreement with one commentator\\'s discussion of the district court\\'s analysis on this issue:. 67. \"While this attribute of the broadcast industry complicates the economic harm analysis, it has no bearing on society\\'s interest in the dissemination of the material or the author\\'s reasonable expectation of compensation for repeated use of his material. These issues, basic to the rationale of the fair use doctrine, implicate the intrinsic qualities of the work, not the medium of its presentation. The Sony court\\'s analysis obfuscated the real issue at stake: whether the public interest in promoting the development of art and science dictates disregarding a copyright holder\\'s interest in controlling the use of his product. In Sony, the copyright owner\\'s interest should have taken precedence.\" 66 Va.L.Rev. at 1020-21.. 68The third factor \"the amount and substantiality of the portions used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole\" clearly weighs against a finding of fair use. The district court acknowledged that \"Home use recording off-the-air usually involves copying the entire work,\" 480 F.Supp. at 454, and that this typically precludes a finding of fair use. The court concluded, however, that the courts have only been concerned about the \"substantiality\" of the copying when it produced harm, and that \"this taking of the whole still constitutes fair use, because there is no accompanying reduction in the market for \\'plaintiff\\'s original work.\\' \" Id. We believe that this view of the case law is completely wrong.. 69In Walt Disney Productions v. Air Pirates, supra, we stated \"While other factors in the fair use calculus may not be sufficient by themselves to preclude the fair use defense, this and other courts have accepted the traditional American rule that excessive copying precludes fair use.\" Id. at 758. In addition, the district court in Loew\\'s Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 131 F.Supp. 165 (S.D.Cal.1955), stated \"The mere absence of competition or injurious effect upon the copyrighted work will not make a use fair. The right of a copyright proprietor to exclude others is absolute and if it has been violated the fact that the infringement will not affect the sale or exploitation of the work or pecuniarily damage him is immaterial.\" Id. at 184. A panel of this court later affirmed Benny v. Loew\\'s, Inc., 239 F.2d 532 (C.A.9 1956), and specifically noted that \"The judgment is affirmed upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the district court and for the reasons set forth in the opinion of (the district judge).\" Id. at 537. These cases clearly did not limit their discussion of \"substantiality\" to cases in which the plaintiff had been harmed. It seems clear that these cases are based, in part, on the notion that copyright is a property interest and that it is impermissible, in the vast majority of cases, to \"appropriate\" the copyrighted material without the owner\\'s consent. The copyright laws afford the author the right to control access to his work, and, absent compelling justifications, this right should not be abridged.. 70We need not rest our holding on the applicability of the \"substantiality\" discussion in Air Pirates and Loew\\'s to the home videorecording context, but it seems clear that this factor in the fair use calculus weighs heavily in appellants\\' favor.. 71The fourth factor \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work\" does not support a contrary result. In light of the preceding discussion, we do not believe that it is necessary to address the harm issue with respect to the liability question. We feel compelled, however, to express our disagreement with the district court\\'s approach on this issue.. 72First, it seems apparent that the district court was much too strict in requiring appellants to establish its degree of harm.11 Our sentiments are the same as those of one of the dissenters in Williams & Wilkins Co. who stated, \"Although the court states that it rejects the trial determinations as to both actual and potential damage to plaintiff, I think the opinion shows that the court\\'s conclusion is based primarily on its finding that plaintiff failed to prove actual damages.\" 487 F.2d at 1367 (Cowen, C. J., dissenting). (Emphasis added.) That is simply too great a burden to impose on copyright plaintiffs. Nimmer has suggested that \"the central question in the determination of fair use is whether the infringing work tends to diminish or prejudice the potential sale of plaintiff\\'s work.\" 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(E)(4)(c) at 13-84. (Emphasis added) (Footnote omitted.)12 Under this sort of standard, it seems clear that appellants should have prevailed. Since the copies made by home videorecording are used for the same purpose as the original, a finding of fair use is not justified.13 The district court seems to recognize, on several occasions, that appellants will have to take affirmative steps to compete with the appropriated versions of their work. That such competition is necessary supports appellants\\' allegations of harm; at the least, it makes clear that the \"infringing\" activity tends to prejudice the potential sale of appellants\\' work. It is clear that home users assign economic value to their ability to have control over access to copyrighted works. The copyright laws would seem to require that the copyright owner be given the opportunity to exploit this market.. 73Second, we do not believe that the district court paid sufficient attention to the fact that it is extremely difficult for a copyright plaintiff to prove harm from the activities of specific defendants. 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(E)(4) (c). As Nimmer states, \"Far from this justifying a defense of fair use, failure to prove damages will in the usual case give rise to a minimum statutory damages liability. It is only when the general dissemination of an allegedly infringing work by all potential defendants, and without limitation as to the number of reproductions, and volume of users would still not adversely affect the plaintiff\\'s potential market that a conclusion of fair use may be justified.\" Id. at 13-84.14 The district court quoted, in what seemed to be an approving manner, similar sentiments from one of Nimmer\\'s law review articles, but the court clearly did not use this rationale in deciding the fair use question. The court, in analyzing the fourth fair use factor, did not pay sufficient attention to the cumulative effect of mass reproduction of copyrighted works made possible by videorecorders. It seems clear that absent an inquiry which takes into consideration the full scope of the \"infringing\" practice, copyright plaintiffs, in cases of this sort, would face insuperable obstacles to the protection of their rights. And, where one looks at the full scope of the activity in question, it seems clear that it tends to diminish the potential market for appellants\\' works.. 74. LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DEFENDANTS. 75We disagree with the district court\\'s conclusion that even if it were to hold that home-use copying was an infringement under the Old and the New Acts and was not fair use, the court could not find the appellees Sonam, Sony, DDBI and the four retail stores liable for this type of infringement. 480 F.Supp. at 457.. 76At the outset, it is necessary to make a couple of observations about the district court\\'s analysis. The court relied heavily on a \"staple item of commerce\"15 theory in rejecting appellants\\' claims. The district court stated that \"Selling of a staple article of commerce e. g., a typewriter, a recorder, a camera, a photocopying machine technically contributes to any infringing use subsequently made thereof, but this kind of \\'contribution,\\' if deemed sufficient as a basis for liability, would expand the theory beyond precedent and arguably beyond judicial management.\" 480 F.Supp. at 461. This reliance on the \"staple article of commerce\" theory was inappropriate. Appellees\\' analogy of videotape records to cameras or photocopying machines may have substantial benefit for some purposes, but does not even remotely raise copyright problems. Videotape recorders are manufactured, advertised, and sold for the primary purpose of reproducing television programming. Virtually all television programming is copyrighted material.16 Therefore, videotape recorders are not \"suitable for substantial noninfringing use.\" See 3 Nimmer supra, § 12.04(A) at 12-39, 12-40. That some copyright owners choose, for one reason or another, not to enforce their rights does not preclude those who legitimately choose to do so from protecting theirs.. 77A second observation about the district court\\'s analysis is in order. The court found that the corporate appellees\\' knowledge was insufficient to make them contributory infringers. This was based, in part, on the court\\'s assertion that \"defendants here could not know what copyright law required. Before this lawsuit, that issue had not been determined.\" 480 F.Supp. at 460. It is not necessary that an alleged contributory infringer have actual knowledge that activity which he makes possible constitutes a copyright infringement. A copyright defendant\\'s \"innocence\" does not absolve him of liability; it only affects the remedies available.17 For example, the statute provides for a reduction of statutory damages if the infringer \"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright,\" 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2), and a remission of statutory damages, in limited circumstances, if the \"infringer believed and had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her use of the copyrighted work was a fair use.\" Id. In this context, a defendant\\'s mistake as to the legal consequences of his actions does not constitute an excuse for an infringement. It is only necessary that a copyright defendant have knowledge of the infringing activity. It cannot be argued that the corporate appellees cannot be held to have the knowledge that the Betamax will be used to reproduce copyrighted material, some of which appellants own. We adopt the district court\\'s definition: \"(O)ne who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another, may be held liable as a \\'contributory\\' infringer.\" Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management, Inc., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (C.A.2 1971) (footnote omitted). There can be no doubt that the corporate appellees meet this definition.. 78First, the knowledge element is clearly satisfied. The corporate appellees \"know\" that the Betamax will be used to reproduce copyrighted materials. In fact, that is the most conspicuous use of the product. That use is intended, expected, encouraged, and the source of the product\\'s consumer appeal. The record establishes that appellees knew and expected that Betamax\\'s major use would be to record copyrighted programs off-the-air. Second, there is no doubt that appellees have met the other requirements for contributory infringement inducing, causing, or materially contributing to the infringing conduct of another. The corporate appellees are sufficiently engaged in the enterprise to be held accountable. See generally 66 Va.L.Rev. at 1021-24; 31 Stan.L.Rev. at 257-260; 52 S.Cal.L.Rev. at 601-607; 81 W.Va.L.Rev. at 247-49.. 79. RELIEF. 80Because we have found that home videorecording constitutes copyright infringement and that appellees are liable for such use, the district court\\'s judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a consideration of the appropriate relief. The relief question is exceedingly complex, and the difficulty in fashioning relief may well have influenced the district court\\'s evaluation of the liability issue. The difficulty of fashioning relief cannot, however, dissuade the federal courts from affording appropriate relief to those whose rights have been infringed.. 81Appellants stated at oral argument that they were seeking a remand to the district court so that the district court could fashion the appropriate relief. This approach makes a good deal of sense; a district court is in a better position to resolve, in an appropriate fashion, the relief question.. 82There are a number of possibilities that the district court may want to consider. Because of the difficulty of proving the precise nature of the harm to appellants, statutory damages may be appropriate. 17 U.S.C. § 504(c). The district court also has a broad range of equitable remedies from which to choose. Section 502(a) provides that the court \"may ... grant temporary and final injunctions on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.\" The district court determined that an injunction would not be an appropriate remedy. 480 F.Supp. 463-69. The court should reconsider this action.. 83We note that, as a general rule, a copyright plaintiff is entitled to a permanent injunction when liability has been established and there is a threat of continuing violations. Indeed, Nimmer states that \"Generally, it would appear to be an abuse of discretion to deny a permanent injunction where liability has been established and there is a threat of continuing infringement.\" 3 Nimmer, supra, § 14.06(B) at 14-53 14-54. In discussing the analogous photocopying area, Nimmer suggests that when great public injury would result from an injunction, a court could award damages or a continuing royalty.18 This may very well be an acceptable resolution in this context.. 84In fashioning relief, the district court should not be overly concerned with the prospective harm to appellees. A defendant has no right to expect a return on investment from activities which violate the copyright laws. Once a determination has been made that an infringement is involved, the continued profitability of appellees\\' businesses is of secondary concern.. 85. RETAIL STORE USE. 86We find no error with the district court\\'s discussion of the fair use question in regard to the retail store use. Therefore, we affirm that portion of the decision.V.. 87. UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS. 88In light of our previous discussion, we have decided to vacate the district court\\'s earlier disposition of the unfair competition claims and remand for reconsideration. We express no view on the merits of these claims.. 89. CROSS-APPEAL. 90The appellees below have cross-appealed because of the district court\\'s failure to receive evidence on three affirmative defenses: (1) laches and estoppel, (2) copyright invalidity, and (3) unclean hands/copyright enforceability. On this appeal, we reverse and remand. The district court should give appellees an opportunity to establish these defenses.. 91. CONCLUSION. 92We find no Congressional intent to create a blanket home use exception to copyright protection and that home videorecording does not constitute fair use. In addition, the appellees are legally responsible for the infringing activity. The district court\\'s decision must be reversed and the case remanded for appropriate proceedings. The court should consider the unfair competition claims and the affirmative defenses. If appellants prevail on the defenses, the district court should fashion appropriate relief.. 93The judgment of the district court is reversed in part, affirmed in part, and the case remanded for appropriate proceedings.. 94IT IS SO ORDERED.. 1 The district court\\'s reasoning has been subject to a number of criticisms. Note, Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp.: \\'Fair Use\\' Looks Different on Videotape. 66 Va.L.Rev. 1005, 1011-12 (1980). Note, The Betamax Case: Accommodating Public Access and Economic Incentive in Copyright Law, 31 Stan.L.Rev. 243, 247 n. 18 (1979); 8 N.Y.U.Rev.L. & Soc. Change, 45, 48-51, 1978-79; Note, Copyright The Home Video Recording Controversy, 81 W.Va.L.Rev. 231, 245-247 (1979). 2 Most of the commentators have found problems with the reasoning underlying the district court\\'s conclusion. 3 Nimmer on Copyright, § 13.05(F)(5) at 13-95-96, n. 159 (1981); Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sony Corp.: \\'Fair Use\\' Looks Different on Videotape, 66 Va.L.Rev. 1005, 1011-12 (1980); Note, The Betamax Case: Accommodating Public Access and Economic Incentive in Copyright Law, 31 Stan.L.Rev. 243, 247, n. 18 (1979); 8 N.Y.U.Rev.L. & Soc. Change 45, 48-51 (1978-79); Note, Copyright The Home Video Recording Controversy, 81 W.Va.L.Rev. 231, 245-47 (1979); Marsh, Betamax and Fair Use: A Shotgun Marriage, 21 Santa Clara L.Rev. 49, 61-67 (1981). 3 17 U.S.C. § 102 lists seven illustrative categories of \"works of authorship\" which are copyrightable. Section 102(a)(6) is \"motion pictures and other audiovisual works\" and § 102(a)(7) is \"sound recordings.\". 4 This reflects, no doubt, the relatively large economic investment involved in the creation of audiovisual works and the especial danger posed by unauthorized reproductions. See Marsh, Betamax and Fair Use: A Shotgun Marriage, 21 Santa Clara L.Rev. 49, 64-66 (1981). 5 This language was not repeated in the legislative history accompanying the 1976 Act. The district court did not find this significant. Nimmer has commented that:\"This conclusion seems questionable on several grounds. First, the failure to repeat in the Committee Reports for the current Act an intention to recognize the home recording exemption referred to in the House Report for the 1971 Amendment is at least as consistent with an altered intention upon the part of the Congress enacting the Act of 1976. This is particularly true in view of the fact that other passages from the House Report for the 1971 Amendment were incorporated verbatim in the House Report for the current Act. ... There is further the fact that the Amendment of 1971 was itself legislation limited to the creation of copyright in sound recordings, and did not (in this context) purport to affect the copyright in musical or other works which may be contained in such sound recordings. Therefore, the home recording exemption referred to in the House Report for the 1971 Amendment could only be applicable to the sound recording copyright, not to the copyright in any underlying work contained therein.... Finally, it is to be noted that the House Report for the current Act states that \\'it is not intended to give (taping) any special status under the fair use provision or to sanction any reproduction beyond the normal and reasonable limits of fair use.\\' H.Rep., p. 66.\" 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(F)(5) at 13-96, n. 159.. 6 The House Report to the 1971 Sound Recording Act carefully excluded sounds accompanying motion pictures from the scope of that particular piece of legislation\"In excluding the \\'sounds accompanying a motion picture\\' from the scope of this legislation the Committee does not intend to limit or otherwise alter the rights that exist currently in such works. The exclusion reflects the Committee\\'s opinion that soundtracks or audio tracks are an integral part of the \\'motion pictures\\' already accorded protection under subsections (l ) and (m) of Section 1 of title 17, and that the reproduction of the sound accompanying a copyrighted motion picture is an infringement of copyright in the motion picture....\" 1971 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 1570-71.. 7 Motion pictures had been protected by the copyright laws since 1912. 8 See 480 F.Supp. at 445-46. The statements of Barbara Ringer and Representative Kastenmeier were made extemporaneously at a committee hearing and on the House floor respectively, and they were in connection with the Sound Recording Act of 1971. The statements do not represent a considered review of the home videorecording problem, and even these statements do not clearly establish an intent to exempt unauthorized reproductions apart from the fair use doctrine. 9 \"(C)ommercial use tends to cut against a fair use defense.\" Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Knight-Ridder Newspapers, 626 F.2d 1171, 1175 (C.A.5 1980) (footnote omitted). Noncommercial motive does not mean fair use. 66 Va.L.Rev. at 1017; Marsh, supra, at 68-71. The \"noncommercial\" characterization of home videorecording is a bit misleading. The corporate defendants involved in the lawsuit are obviously not in the business of promoting home videorecording for strictly altruistic reasons. 10 Rohauer v. Killiam Shows, Inc., 379 F.Supp. 723, 733 (S.D.N.Y.1974), rev\\'d on other grounds, 551 F.2d 484 (C.A.2 1977), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 949, 97 S.Ct. 2666, 53 L.Ed.2d 266 (\"There is no discernible public interest in the dissemination of \\'The Son of the Sheik\\' sufficient to justify the infringement.... It can scarcely be argued here that the enduring fame of Rudolph Valentino or the intrinsic literary and historical merit of \\'The Son of the Shiek\\' (whatever it may be) serves any public interest sufficient to endow these defendants with the privilege of fair use.\"); Loew\\'s Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 131 F.Supp. 165, 175 (S.D.Cal.1955), aff\\'d sub nom. Benny v. Loew\\'s, Inc., 239 F.2d 532 (C.A.9 1956), aff\\'d. by an equally divided court, 356 U.S. 43, 78 S.Ct. 667, 2 L.Ed.2d 583 (1958). 11 The courts typically state that irreparable harm is presumed. Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corp. v. Crooks, 447 F.Supp. 243, 247, 251 (W.D.N.Y.1978). The presumption noted in Crooks was not because of the procedural posture (motion for preliminary injunction). The court noted that, at trial, the defendant would have an opportunity to rebut the presumption. In our case, it is clear that appellees did not establish with any degree of certainty that such harm was not likely to occur. 12 The Second Circuit has used this approach. Meeropol v. Nizer, 560 F.2d 1061, 1070 (C.A.2 1977). 13 Put another way, because the copies serve the same function as the original, the \"functional test\" suggests that fair use is not available. 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(B); Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. v. Showcase Atlanta Cooperative Productions, Inc., 479 F.Supp. 351 (N.D.Ga.1979). 14 Senate Report 94-473 seems to express a somewhat similar concern about mass proliferation of minor infringements: \"Isolated instances of minor infringements, when multiplied many times, become in the aggregate a major inroad on copyright that must be prevented.\" Id. at 65. 15 See 35 U.S.C. § 271(c) (defining contributory infringement in patent context and providing for exception for \"a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use\"); Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Co., 377 U.S. 476, 488-89, 84 S.Ct. 1526, 1533-34, 12 L.Ed.2d 457 (1964). 16 For examples, see Nimmer, supra, § 12.04(A) at 12-39-40. 17 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.08. This discussion of \"liability\" obviously only pertains to civil, not criminal, liability. 18 \"Ordinarily it would be improper, and even an abuse of discretion for a court to deny a permanent injunction where liability and a threat of continuing infringement have both been established. But if one looks to other areas of property law it is clear that a property owner may be denied a permanent injunction against further violations of his property right where such an injunction would work a substantial injury to the public interest as well as to that of the particular defendant. In such circumstances the property owner may be awarded, in lieu of an injunction, a reasonable royalty for the further use of his property. The courts might well conclude that photocopying practices for private use, particularly in the area of scientific writings, involve just such a public interest, so that a judicially created compulsory license as a substitute for injunctive relief could be found appropriate.\" 3 Nimmer, supra, § 13.05(E)(4)(e) at 13-91.

And I started from the bottom. Like a snowman—ground-up. Like round chuck, and still put hands on you. Stayin\\' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?). Sucker free, confidence high. Such a breeze when I pen rhymes. I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah). \\'Nother day in the life (Uh). Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah). Now my community\\'s gated and I. Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi). I\\'m givin\\' \\'em pounds, I\\'m upscale now. Guess it means I\\'m way in the sky (Way in the sky). But I still remember the days of. Minimum wage for general labor. Welfare recipient since a minor. Look how government assistance has made ya!. Adversity, if at first you don\\'t succeed. Put your temper to more use. \\'Cause bein\\' broke\\'s a poor excuse. That should only give you more fuel. Show \\'em why you\\'re you. So close, God, it\\'s like I almost got it. But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes. So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!. Screw it, I\\'m lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick. That\\'s why they call me firecracker. I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse. I got some important news to report to. Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite. Spotlight\\'s back on, got my faith, where\\'s yours?. You might also like[Chorus]. Do you still believe in me?. Didn\\'t I give everything I had to give you to make you see?. I\\'ll never forget if you turn your back on me now. And walk out, I will never let you live it down. I\\'ll never quit, do you still believe in me?. . [Verse 2]. Man, I know sometimes. These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice. To me they\\'re just ink blots. I just fling \\'em like slingshots and so precise. So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah). Or you retards can roll the dice. But beef will at least cost you your career. \\'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced. But this middle finger\\'s free as a bird. Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth. Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned. How to incorporate a curse. Point it towards corporate America. Stick a fork in and turn. \\'Cause four-letter words are more better heard. The world force-fed a turd to me, you\\'re getting yours. But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it. I was there consolin\\' you when no one knew it. When your situation showed no improvement. I was that door, you walked over to it. I\\'m the light at the end of the tunnel. So people are always lookin\\' to me as they\\'re goin\\' through it. When that tunnel vision is unclear. Shit becomes too much to bear. Since \"Cleanin\\' Out My Closet\". When I was havin\\' trouble with the snare. I\\'m that unrealistic prayer answered. And I\\'ma get you jacked up like you\\'re tryna fix a flat, uh. When you struggle with despair. That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair. Of nuts I\\'m cuppin\\', I am your \\'fuck it\\' switch, nothin\\' can compare. [Chorus]. Do you still believe in me?. Didn\\'t I give everything I had to give you to make you see?. I\\'ll never forget if you turn your back on me now. And walk out, I will never let you live it down. I\\'ll never quit, do you still believe in me?. . [Verse 3]. Started from the bottom like a snowman. Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that. But my battery\\'s low, I\\'ma need a boost to my pack. And I know that I always got Proof at my back. I called you \"Proof\" because I knew for a fact. My ace in the hole, homie, I\\'m callin\\' on you. \\'Cause I think I\\'m slowly startin\\' to lose faith in it, so. Give me that inkling and mo–. –tivation to go, Hussein with the flow. Fake fans that are two-faced didn\\'t show. Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul. Layin\\' vocals two days in a row. True statement, hate to go down this road. But there\\'s only one route to cross this bridge. So I walk in this bitch with loose change. \\'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth\\'s takin\\' its toll. But it\\'s never too late to start a new beginnin\\'. That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon\\' do?. Use the tools you\\'re given!. Or you\\'re gon\\' use the cards you\\'re dealt. As an excuse for you to not do shit with \\'em?. I used to play the loser/victim. \\'Til I saw the way Proof was driven. I found my vehicle and I haven\\'t ran out of gas yet. And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets. Fanny packs, hourglasses. If time was on my side, I\\'d still have none to waste. Man, in my younger days. That dream was so much fun to chase. It\\'s like I\\'d run in place. While this shit dangled in front of my face. But how do you keep up the pace. And the hunger pangs once you\\'ve won the race?. When that dual exhaust is coolin\\' off. \\'Cause you don\\'t got nothin\\' left to prove at all. \\'Cause you done already hit \\'em with the coup de grâce. Still you feel the need to go full tilt. That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill. When that wheel\\'s loose, I won\\'t lose will. Do you still believe?336Embed',\n \"1 ContributorIntoxicated (Radio Edit) LyricsIntro:.

If that means what I think it means, we\\'re in trouble, big trouble;\\xa0. And if he is as bananas as you say, I\\'m not taking any chances\". \"You are just what the doc ordered\". . [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce. You might also like[Chorus]. \\'Cause I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin\\' this shit ain\\'t that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I\\'ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I\\'ll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it\\'s all a game, \\'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin\\'?. Little gay-lookin\\' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin\\' boy (Ha-ha!). You\\'re witnessin\\' a mass-occur. Like you\\'re watching a church gathering take place, lookin\\' boy. \"Oy vey, that boy\\'s gay!\"—that\\'s all they say, lookin\\' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin\\' boy. Hey, lookin\\' boy! What you say, lookin\\' boy?. I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin\\' boy. I\\'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin\\' boy!. Basically, boy, you\\'re never gonna be capable. Of keepin\\' up with the same pace, lookin\\' boy, \\'cause—. [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I\\'m racin\\' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet\\'s Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard. . [Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed',\n \"52 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsHold Back the River Lyrics[Verse 1]. Tried to keep you close to me. But life got in between.

The joke\\'s on you.. . -- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As. the saying goes . . . it\\'s nice to see a man who enjoys his work.. . 14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor. of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --. . 15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY. A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to. the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL. FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.. . While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point. behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS. and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the. statue\\'s upraised TORCH.. . The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the. far side of the torch.. . RINGLEADER. I don\\'t like this.  Go downstairs and see what\\'s up.. . 16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY. RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.. . RORSCHACH. Got your flashgun?. . CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and. goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits. behind.. . 17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY. The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue\\'s layout.. He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,. then strolls over and jimmies it open.. . ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one\\'s different.. This one\\'s a WOMAN.. . SILK SPECTRE. About time.  It stinks down there.. . COMEDIAN. B-team\\'s upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.. . As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched. wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME. underneath.. . SILK SPECTRE. Why do I get all the glamour jobs?. . COMEDIAN. A woman\\'s work is never done.. . 18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY. The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,. CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their. guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a. TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.. . RINGLEADER. I don\\'t know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.. . CAPT. METROPOLIS. Please.  There\\'s something I\\'d like you to see first.. . He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer\\'s flash.. All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding. light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the. floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.. . All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who\\'s wearing his special sunglasses.. He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.. . 19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER. An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he\\'s grabbed. from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at. his throat.. . COMEDIAN. Okay, Abdul.  Where\\'s the bomb?. . 20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY. Everyone\\'s slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the. TERRORISTS tied up; he\\'s consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.. . CAPT. METROPOLIS. Don\\'t cry, little one.  You\\'re in good hands.. (standing; to the crowd). Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We\\'re going out through the torch.. . He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the. torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.. . 21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER. A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH. secures it to the tip of the torch.. . 22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT. SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.. . SILK SPECTRE. Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .. . COMEDIAN. Just barge in.  While they\\'re staring at your tits we\\'ll blow their. balls off.. . They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead. landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist. hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the. landing.. . 23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER. Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS\\' BOMB, and it\\'s a big fat one, sits. in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with. UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the. COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:. . COMEDIAN. Well.  They look distracted.. (turning to face her). Don\\'t suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?. . SILK SPECTRE. Eddie -- !. . Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He. turns.. . One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself. over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A. SWITCH on the housing.. . A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.. . COMEDIAN. SHIT!. . He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to. blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An. empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.. . SILK SPECTRE. What about the --. . COMEDIAN. FUCK \\'EM!. . There\\'s a mountain-climber\\'s CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it. around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only. a second before following suit.. . 24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER. CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,. he FREEZES.  There\\'s a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as. well.. . 25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL\\'s instrument panel.. He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.. . NIGHT OWL. Adrian!. . VEIDT. Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.. . NIGHT OWL. Well, good God, we can\\'t just --. . VEIDT. Mission aborted, Daniel!. . NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.. . 26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT. On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.. . 27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER. The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS. throwing off sparks against the cable.. . 28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER. CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands. pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and. RORSCHACH, who\\'s hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off. the torch.. . 29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT. THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE. touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator. doors open, and the two of them dive through.. . 30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER. RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP. streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure. of Lady Liberty.. . Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.. . 31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an. overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.. . 32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER. Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat. against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling. DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.. . 33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER. The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of. the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He. turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.. . SWAT CAPTAIN. That\\'s it.  I quit.. . The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --. . 34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY. -- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through. the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the. demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes. wondering what the hell happened to his date.. . Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.. MANHATTAN.. . Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --. are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge. blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:. . COMEDIAN. ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?. . CUT TO:. . 35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT. The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.. . SHEILA. In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has. revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt\\'s super-team.  Local police. have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the. Watchmen are dropped.. . On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars. surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.. . JIM. And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which. would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage. is expected.. (shuffling his papers). Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially. history.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE. TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather. clocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD. through a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of. midnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without. warning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade. downward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:. . WATCHMEN. . FADE THROUGH TO:. . 37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT. Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT. UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP. drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo. faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where. heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED. PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:. . NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER. . 38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by. the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the. high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated. bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on. their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.. . A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON. AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.\". . CUSTOMER. Crazy reds don\\'t know who they\\'re messing with.. (indicating the cop cars). What happened over there?. . NEWS VENDOR. Some guy went sidewalk divin\\'  Twenny-five cents.. . 39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT. A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from. the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare. with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.. . PATROLMAN. STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!. . We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of. reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the. city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:. his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his. plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears. a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the. back of a waiting ambulance.. . DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and. buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the. investigation.. . BURNS. Had a lot of blood in him.. . HYDE. You oughta see upstairs.  It\\'s a slaughterhouse.. . BURNS. No idea who\\'s behind this?. . HYDE. Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.. . BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.. . BURNS. He would -- You might as well know.  It\\'s gonna get messy.  We got a. call from Washington.. . HYDE. Washington?. . BURNS. They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.. . HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after. the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.. . 40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. . TIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,. a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk. spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make. out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.. . The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his. collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against. the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,. cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in. response and plugs on.. . At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the. sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET. CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain. grate.. . It\\'s a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its. surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to. midnight.. . The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the. shattered window some forty stories above.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT. CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted. corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading. \"POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.\"  At the far end is a single door,. SEALED OFF.. . 42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT. MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and. overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture. window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are. flapping wildly.. . A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.. . SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps. inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is. invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the. room.. . The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,. gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The. flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS. and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.. . The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains. of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky. glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for. his face.. . He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and. ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should. be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.. . We\\'ve met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.. . 43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. RORSCHACH\\'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk. dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.. Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.. He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his. trenchcoat pocket.. . 44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,. and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.. RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive. suits.. . He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on. the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.. THUMP.. . He pauses.  He\\'s found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully. along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a. CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing. a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.. . He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a. bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,. rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed. PHOTOGRAPH.. . RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It\\'s a group shot, six men, one woman,. all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is. wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN\\'s. costume.. . They\\'re all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.. METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH. himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT. A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner. store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with. the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated. -- old before his time.. . He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough. to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.. . 46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT. In an alleyway just off the access street, there\\'s a MUGGING in. progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in. knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG. sees what\\'s happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious. decision to move on.  Then --. . VOICE. Hold up, papa-san!. . The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and. spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they. march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,. almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we. . CUT TO:. . 47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE. Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the. gimmick, it should suggest that the events we\\'re watching take place. in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.. . It\\'s out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in. an alleyway not unlike the one we\\'ve just left.  There\\'s a flurry of. fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--. . -- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,. transporting us back to:. . 48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT. Real-time again.  Our reverie\\'s been interrupted by a SHAFT OF. WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the. alley.. . LOUDSPEAKER. HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --. . The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the. LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair. some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of. the kids.. . DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the. alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past. help.. . 49. INT. DREIBERG\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The. security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN\\'s. apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.. . DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs. it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for. the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most. peculiar sight:. . DREIBERG. . . . Rorschach.. . 50. INT. DREIBERG\\'S KITCHEN - NIGHT. Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is. the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,. exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he\\'s calmly eating a plate of. baked beans.. . DREIBERG. How did you get in here?. . Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,. utterly emotionless whisper:. . RORSCHACH. Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.. . DREIBERG. Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?. . DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn\\'t care less --. emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can. onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup. from a squeeze bottle.. . DREIBERG (cont.). I can\\'t believe you\\'re back on the streets.  Good God, man, you\\'re. wanted on fourteen counts of murder.. . RORSCHACH. At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.. . He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it. to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his. fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Look familiar?. . DREIBERG. Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.. . RORSCHACH. Human bean juice.. (beat). The Comedian is dead.. . DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.. His jaw goes slack.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --. beautiful view.. Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.. . DREIBERG. Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?. . RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.. . DREIBERG (cont.). Well, God, he\\'d been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he. must\\'ve had enemies.. . RORSCHACH. So do I.  So do you.. . DREIBERG. Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that\\'s just. paranoia.. . RORSCHACH\\'s head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG. blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But. RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the. front door.. . RORSCHACH. Maybe.  Or maybe somebody\\'s finally caught up with us.  Somebody with. a grudge.. (pause). Thought you might want to spread the word.. . DREIBERG. Hey.  Hey.  If you don\\'t mind, use the back stairs, all right?. . RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He. opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.. . RORSCHACH. You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.. . He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo. from the COMEDIAN\\'s wall.  A moment later, he\\'s gone.. . DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,. CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple. tunic and mask . . .. . 51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT. A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is. far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome. desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is. ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he\\'s. DREIBERG\\'s age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and. pale, he looks thirty.  When he\\'s sixty he\\'ll look forty.. . VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic. patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his. office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the. like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE. RINGS.. . VEIDT. Veidt here.. . 52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT. DREIBERG. Adrian?  Listen, it\\'s Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.. I had to call you before he --. . VEIDT. Daniel, slow down.  What\\'s this about Rorschach?. . DREIBERG. The Comedian.  He\\'s dead.  Murdered.  That\\'s all I know.. . VEIDT. My God.  Murdered?  -- What\\'s this have to do with Rorschach?. . DREIBERG. It\\'s -- he\\'s got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone\\'s. . . . I don\\'t know, stalking us.. . VEIDT. Us.  You mean the Watchmen.. . The big CAT purrs; it\\'s a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red. fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a. chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders. DREIBERG\\'s words.. . VEIDT (cont.). Daniel, Rorschach is insane.. . DREIBERG. I know, I know, it\\'s just -- he\\'s back on the street, he smells. blood.. . VEIDT. You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs. -- then he\\'s satisfied.  It blows over.. . DREIBERG. He\\'s bound to get caught.  I don\\'t want my name coming out.  Not at. this late date.. . VEIDT. If he comes here, I\\'ll handle him.  Remember -- I\\'ve always protected. you.  Haven\\'t I?. (slight pause). Do you need money?. . DREIBERG. No.  I just wanted you to --. . VEIDT. You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let\\'s stay in touch, okay?  Good. night.. . DREIBERG. Good night.. . VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a. cigarette.  It\\'s \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of. the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a. long, slow drag.. . CUT TO:. . 53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT. Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the. checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE. rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign. which reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\". . 54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT. ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED. ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door. with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a. six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .. . . . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple. doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and. wait -- to VEIDT\\'s great amusement.. . The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned. woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK. SPECTRE.. . LAURIE. Adrian.. . VEIDT. Laurie!  Good to see you.. . She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall. in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.. . LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized. machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific. paraphernalia of every description.. . VEIDT (cont.). Nice.  Who\\'s your decorator -- Edward Teller?. . LAURIE. Don\\'t rub it in.  I live here.. . VEIDT. And how\\'s life with the walking H-bomb?. . LAURIE. He\\'s in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.. . She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT. wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A. SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:. . VEIDT. Hi, Jon.. . DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.). (a deep, booming voice). Hello, Adrian.. . DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under. any circumstances, but at the moment he\\'s downright gargantuan.. Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he\\'s calmly adjusting a. calibration atop his particle accelerator.. . DR. MANHATTAN (cont.). I think I\\'m about to detect a gluino.. . In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just. about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the. physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of. time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.. . Any government would be glad to have him.. . VEIDT. Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann. caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .. . LAURIE, who\\'s just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.. . LAURIE. Please, you guys, no shop talk.. (to DR. MANHATTAN). Jon, you\\'re being rude.  Why don\\'t you shrivel on down and join us?. . DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable. six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist. -- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:. . LAURIE (cont.). Good to see you, Adrian.  What\\'s the occasion?. . He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.. . VEIDT. . . . Are we being monitored?. . DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the. little red \"ON\" lights wink out.. . DR. MANHATTAN. The bearer of bad news.. . VEIDT. We\\'ve lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.. . LAURIE. Blake?  Dead?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington\\'s asked me to attend the. funeral as a matter of protocol.. . LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first. she\\'s heard about it.. . VEIDT. Rorschach\\'s on the case.  He\\'s got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to. think that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.. . VEIDT. What\\'s your theory?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don\\'t concern. me.. . VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is. considerably less amused.. . LAURIE. I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?. . VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another. part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as. we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and. floats off to one side.. . A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of. the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in. midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn\\'t lifted a finger; he\\'s dismantling and. reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.. . VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes. the conversation without missing a beat:. . VEIDT. I guess you\\'ll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.. . DR. MANHATTAN. You mean Afghanistan?. (beat). It won\\'t require my attention.  What I\\'m doing here is far more. interesting.. . The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The. cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws. itself shut.. . VEIDT. Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as. usual -- I can\\'t tell you anything you don\\'t already know.  Goodbye,. Jon.. . DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds. his coat where LAURIE put it.  He\\'s just about to leave when she. arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.. . LAURIE. Adrian!  Don\\'t leave so soon.  I --. . VEIDT. I\\'ll take a raincheck, Laurie.. . LAURIE. Please.. . There\\'s a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his. shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who\\'s forty feet tall again, playing. with his superaccelerator.. . VEIDT. He\\'s a little farther gone every time.. . LAURIE. Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to. someone human.. (beat). He doesn\\'t think like we do.  He doesn\\'t even feel what we feel.  I. mean -- he even scares the research teams.. . VEIDT. Laurie -- he\\'s the most powerful man who\\'s ever lived.  He\\'s changed. the world.. . LAURIE. (embarrassed). I know.  I shouldn\\'t be saying this.  He\\'s happy, he\\'s content, he\\'s. doing his work --. . VEIDT. What about you?. . LAURIE. I suppose I\\'m serving my purpose, aren\\'t I.. (pause). I\\'ll ring for the guards.. . She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,. concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest. pocket for a cigarette case:. . VEIDT. Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.. (handing her a cigarette). Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don\\'t you give. Daniel a call?  I\\'m sure he\\'d be glad to hear from you.. . LAURIE. Maybe I\\'ll do that.. . VEIDT. I\\'m sorry about Blake.. . He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS. appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.. . LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman. lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and. WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren\\'t there.. . CUT TO:. . 55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY\\'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT. A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,. popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow. stairway which dips well below street level.. . 56. INT. HAPPY HARRY\\'S - NIGHT. The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS. hover at the entrance to the men\\'s room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS. stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and. grind.  Suddenly there\\'s a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.. . Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE. off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of. vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the. bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing. glasses.. . RORSCHACH. Harry.. . HARRY. (petrified). R-Rorschach.. . RORSCHACH. Phone\\'s out of order.  Mind if I use yours?. . He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH. picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS. and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.. . He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:. . RORSCHACH. Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might\\'ve had. help.. (wandering through the room). Thought maybe you could fill me in.. . ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as. RORSCHACH strolls past.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?. (moving on). Johnny Gobs.  What\\'s new at the schoolyard?. . Behind RORSCHACH\\'s back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively. toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,. yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?. . NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH. extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --. . -- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He. closes a gloved fist around NICKY\\'s pinky finger, twists it back and. SNAPS IT.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Edward Blake.  Who killed him?. . No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH. grabs his index finger and repeats the process.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Who killed Edward Blake?. . NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to. the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He\\'s standing poised to let. fly at NICKY\\'s ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.. . VOICE. JESUS!  HE\\'S IN SHOCK!!. . RORSCHACH. THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?. . By now HARRY\\'s pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.. Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It. catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of. glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the. ceiling.. . SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH\\'s next move.  He. looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:. . RORSCHACH (cont.). So many vermin . . . so little time.. . He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY\\'s quivering frame, and tosses it. contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long. enough to HISS at the crowd:. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I\\'ll be. around.. . . CUT TO:. . 57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN. The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller. research complex.  It\\'s not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and. LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over. to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is. empty.. . LAURIE. (muttering; groggy). Jon . . . ?. . A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE. closes her eyes and sighs.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'m here, Laurie.. . LAURIE. Is it time?  D\\'you have to leave for the funeral?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Not yet, there\\'s plenty of time.. . A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.. DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.. . LAURIE. Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?. . The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE\\'s shoulder and arm,. toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Would you like me to stay?. . LAURIE. Mm hmm.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I could stay and go.. . LAURIE. . . . And just how would you manage that?. . She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its. downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is. massaging LAURIE\\'s thigh.. . Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE\\'s eyes go suddenly. wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.. . DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the. foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.. . LAURIE. AAAAAAAAAA!!. . DR. MANHATTAN I. Laurie?  Are you --. . DR. MANHATTAN II. Don\\'t be upset.. . This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE\\'s. fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a. dressing gown.. . LAURIE. Jon, please.  I don\\'t enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one. person again, please?. . The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical. gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.. . DR. MANHATTAN I. Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --. . DR. MANHATTAN II. -- you would find it erotic.. . LAURIE. All right, all right.  It\\'s just -- my nerves, I\\'m going stir-crazy. in this place, I --. . While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance. through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,. she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an. experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through. the door . . .. . 58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER. . . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:. . LAURIE. You\\'ve been out here all along, haven\\'t you?  Running one of your. stupid experiments --. . DR. MANHATTAN III. Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.. . LAURIE. So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how. could you do this?. . DR. MANHATTAN III. You seem to feel I\\'ve been neglecting you.  Isn\\'t that the case?. (pause). I thought I\\'d solved the problem quite elegantly.. . LAURIE. That\\'s all it is to you, isn\\'t it?  Just another problem you. can --. . She doesn\\'t see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered. the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:. . DR. MANHATTANS I & II. Laurie, please --. . LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back. slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.. . LAURIE. Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I. could really use the time alone.. . She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &. II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original. DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his. equipment.. . FADE THROUGH TO:. . 1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT. A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard. at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly. beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it\\'s largely. wasted on her preoccupied date.. . At the moment, she\\'s filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:. . LAURIE. The government\\'s really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I. guess it\\'s no picnic being the world\\'s only superhuman.. (mock-macho). I have to keep him in line.. . She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to. laugh.  He doesn\\'t.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has. wandered off into a far corner of the room.. . LAURIE (cont.). Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?. . DREIBERG. Sorry, it\\'s this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don\\'t really think. anyone\\'s out to get us -- do you?. . LAURIE. Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let\\'s face it, Eddie Blake was no. Mother Teresa.. . DREIBERG. Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .. . LAURIE. Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the. government or do time.. . DREIBERG. Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It\\'s a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty. tricks -- political assassinations --. . Now he\\'s got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then. leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:. . LAURIE. Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us. made other choices.. . DREIBERG. (shaking his head in disgust). . Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors. . . . and I\\'m still in the psycho file with Rorschach.. . LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.. . DREIBERG (cont.). What\\'s so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?. . LAURIE. I\\'m just wondering what you would\\'ve said ten years ago if you could. see yourself right now.. (raising her glass). Well, here\\'s to the Comedian.  \\'Cause the fact is, he\\'s dead . . .. and we\\'re not.. . DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.. . 1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT. DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,. which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They\\'re holding big snifters. of brandy, and they\\'re both pretty well drunk.. . DREIBERG. The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I. mean, we were heroes!. . LAURIE. Damn straight.. . DREIBERG. Damn straight!  We were heroes.. . LAURIE. Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.. . DREIBERG. Well, that was Adrian\\'s idea.  I know he\\'s the smartest man in the. world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .. . LAURIE. (smiling). Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?. What was his name . . .. . DREIBERG. Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we\\'d. beat him up?. . LAURIE. That\\'s the one.  Whatever happened to him?. . DREIBERG. (deadpan). He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an. elevator shaft.. . LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to. her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she\\'s GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA. PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a. stentorian VOICE over scene:. . CHAPLAIN (V.O.). In the midst of life we are in death . . .. . CUT TO:. . 59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY. AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.. . CHAPLAIN. . . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall. change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --. . TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of. mourners.  There\\'s no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the. attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons. of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off. with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.. . CHAPLAIN (cont.). -- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all. things unto himself.. . A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.. MANHATTAN, of course, doesn\\'t need one -- the raindrops vanish. miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the. distance, and he glances off at:. . 60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT. SENTRIES stand at attention.  They\\'ve blocked off the part of the. cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has. been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like. wildfire.. . MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the. cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due. respect for the dead, Arlington National\\'s turning into a zoo:. gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their. hands full managing the crowd.. . A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to. join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the. VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.. . It\\'s not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled. marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,. and he\\'s cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,. Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze. plaque bears the inscription:. . IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS. WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES. TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM. . Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four. hundred of them.. . 61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT. The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE\\'s home sweet. home.  Her car pulls up to the guard\\'s booth and he waves her. through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind. her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.. . 62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT. LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,. fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the. card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.. . She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls. up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps. out.. . LAURIE. Major Adamson, I can\\'t seem to get in the door.. . ADAMSON. Laurie, I\\'ll have to ask you to come with me.. . LAURIE. Why?  What\\'s the problem?. . ADAMSON. I can\\'t tell you that.  It is quite urgent.. . LAURIE. (chuckling). I would like to use the bathroom --. . As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.. . ADAMSON. The access code\\'s been changed.  Your card won\\'t work anymore.. . LAURIE. What?!. . ADAMSON. Please.. . The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The. GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.. . ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE\\'s climbing inside when she. sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.. . The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging. from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION. SUITS.. . 63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT. LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to. a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard. at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white. gown:. . NURSE. Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.. . LAURIE. What -- ?. . DOCTOR. Drink this.. . The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She. stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.. . DOCTOR. Drink it.. . 64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT. TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are. shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of. a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens. on:. . 65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT. We\\'re watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A. donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,. foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to. the anteroom.. . Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head. wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right. as she wonders just what the hell is going on.. . 66. INT. DOCTOR\\'S OFFICE - NIGHT. A MAN\\'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.. . LAURIE (O.S.). That\\'s Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon\\'s military liaison.. . LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table. surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent. SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken. from a thick sheaf.. . LAURIE (cont.). Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon\\'s research teams.  The. quantum-whatever.. . SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It\\'s a group shot of the. Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE\\'s closet.  LAURIE. hesitates.. . LAURIE (cont.). That\\'s Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.. (long pause). Rorschach . . .. . SCHMIDT. Their real names, please.. . LAURIE. I don\\'t know their real names.. . SCHMIDT. You\\'re lying, Miss Juspeczyk.. . LAURIE. I don\\'t know their real names!. . SCHMIDT. You\\'re not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people\\'s lives may depend on. the answers you give.. (holding up the sheaf of photos). These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --. . LAURIE. Then why don\\'t you ask him?!?. . Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby. window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced. torturers, they understand the value of patience.. . LAURIE (cont.). I want to get dressed.  -- And I\\'d like a cigarette.. . One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out. for LAURIE.  As he\\'s lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door. opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.. . He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and. tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with. curiosity:. . LAURIE (cont.). Someone had better tell me what\\'s going on here!. . SCHMIDT. Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file. are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else. in common as well.. (beat). They\\'ve all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.. . LAURIE. What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?. . All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE\\'s face goes. bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she. takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she\\'s read.. . SCHMIDT. I\\'m terribly sorry.. . LAURIE. What does this mean?  What does it --. . SCHMIDT. Six to eight months.  That\\'s with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can. see why it\\'s so vital that we locate your . . . friends.. . LAURIE. That\\'s it.  This is all a trick, isn\\'t it?  Some kind of horrible. joke to make me --. . She scans the room.  No one\\'s laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to. his comrades, and heads for the door.. . SCHMIDT. Take a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a. call.. . The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches. for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,. she buries her face in her hands.. . 67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT. A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a. two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who\\'s been. watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.. . ADAMSON. Poor kid.. . SCHMIDT. We\\'ll keep her in isolation awhile.  She\\'ll give us some names.. . ADAMSON. To hell with those costumed idiots.  I\\'m worried about Doc. Manhattan.. . SCHMIDT. What do you mean?. . ADAMSON. She\\'s his last link to humanity.  Once she\\'s gone . . . God knows. which way he\\'ll jump.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY. DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He\\'s wearing. a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie. with an irregular mauve pattern.. . The tie doesn\\'t quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie. magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal. gold stripes.. . Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into. a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for. decoration.. . It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the. mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.. . 69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY. TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green. room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.. . DIRECTOR. We\\'re on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is. that big blue son of a --. . He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just. rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR\\'s. face.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'m sorry.  Am I late?. . DIRECTOR. No problem.  We\\'ll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I\\'m. Kent Turner, the director. . .. . The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN\\'s hand and marches him down a. hallway.  Within seconds they\\'re joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.. . LIAISON. Dr. Osterman.  I\\'ve got a list of taboo areas here we\\'d like you to. steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you\\'ll. just play it cool --. . DIRECTOR. Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give. us something a little darker . . . ?. . DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Will this do?. . DIRECTOR. Perfect.. . LIAISON. Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --. . But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by. a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are. hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON. hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS. SPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC. underneath.. . 70. INSERT - TV MONITOR. Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for. their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right. and takes in an extraordinary sight.. . A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through. the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the. greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts. of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation. crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:. \"VIETNAM.  1965.\". . ANNOUNCER (V.O.). Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific. mishap.  For more than twenty years the \"Manhattan Option\" has been. the linchpin of America\\'s conventional strategy --. . We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad. thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds. a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.. . His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey. gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM. hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met. with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:. \"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\". . ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.). -- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a. one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding. the Communist menace in check.. . DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from. American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake. hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a. three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic. accord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\". . ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.). In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,. there is a Superman -- and thank God, he\\'s American.\". . 71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY. A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop. of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded. news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host\\'s chair:. . BRINKLEY. For this live question-and-answer session we\\'ll be joined by. correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,. I\\'ll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.. (turning). Now let\\'s welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better. known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.. . Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at. BRINKLEY\\'s right.  He nods in acknowledgement.. . BRINKLEY (cont.). I suppose the topic on everyone\\'s mind this week is Afghanistan,. where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now. since you\\'ve dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .. . . I\\'ll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that. you intervene?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I will not intervene in Afghanistan.. . A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.. . 72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON. Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.. . 73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN. HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.. BRINKLEY ignores them:. . BRINKLEY. You\\'re saying you would refuse a direct request?. . DR. MANHATTAN. There will be no request.  I will not intervene.. . BRINKLEY. Well, Doctor, it\\'s widely understood, or rumored, that you can. actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the. hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?. . 74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON. He\\'s steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he\\'s hanging on. DR. MANHATTAN\\'s every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE. in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:. . LIAISON. I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.. . 75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN. DR. MANHATTAN. I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.. (long pause). I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will. not intervene.. . He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.. . BRINKLEY. Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I\\'ll. open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?. . REPORTER. Dr. Osterman, I\\'m Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I\\'d like to read. you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.. Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?. . DR. MANHATTAN. All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.. . ROTH. Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.. Are you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all. been diagnosed with terminal cancer?. . The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY\\'s taken aback.  He. gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face. an unreadable mask.. . 76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON. eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone. . LIAISON. Oh Jesus.. (barking into phone). I want this broadcast killed.  I\\'ll run out on that goddamn set if I. have to!. . 77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN. ROTH. I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly. diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a. connection?. . By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make. himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who\\'s just gotten a message. from the booth, touches his headset and announces:. . BRINKLEY. I\\'m told it\\'s time for a break.  We\\'ll be back after this brief. message --. . Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,. flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.. . LIAISON. THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW\\'S OVER!!. . The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,. PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB. THE SET.. . RANDOM NEWSMEN. Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause. cancer??. . DR. MANHATTAN. I don\\'t wish to answer any questions.. . RANDOM NEWSMEN. You see the future!  Did you know in advance --. . LIAISON. The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP. ASIDE!!. . The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but. the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.. . RANDOM NEWSMEN. How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this. information --. . DR. MANHATTAN. Please get out of my way.. . The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.. SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it\\'s getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN. lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:. . DR. MANHATTAN. I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!. . In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no. microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.. MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.. . BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,. there\\'s an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,. leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.. . CUT TO:. . 78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT. The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is. overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post. quarantine notices at the entrances.  He\\'s not altogether surprised. when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Where\\'s Laurie?. . ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He\\'s not wearing a radiation suit, and. he\\'s understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely. necessary.. . ADAMSON. She\\'s been relocated, Jon.  It\\'s strictly precautionary . . .. . DR. MANHATTAN. There\\'s no need to lie.  I assume she\\'s been tested.  Were the. results positive?. . ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.. . DR. MANHATTAN (cont.). Don\\'t bother.  I already know what you\\'ll say.. . He watches impassively as what\\'s left of his home is dismantled.  His. mind is already a million miles away.. . ADAMSON. Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .. could you cure her?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I don\\'t know.  I only know that I won\\'t.. (long pause). There\\'d be no point.  It\\'s finally begun.. . ADAMSON. \"Begun?\"  What\\'s begun?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'ve seen this day.  It\\'s the day I\\'ve been dreading all these years.. (pause). You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I. cared for . . .. . ADAMSON doesn\\'t know what he\\'s talking about, but a chill runs down. his spine nonetheless.. . DR. MANHATTAN. My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.. . And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves. behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at. the Major\\'s feet.. . ADAMSON. Good Lord --. . CUT TO:. . 79. EXT. OUTER SPACE. -- and it\\'s about as exterior as you can get.  We\\'re a few. hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily. apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily. beautiful. -- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white. clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing. our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.. . It\\'s DR. MANHATTAN.  He\\'s in a lotus position, sitting on. nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.. Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he\\'s about to. leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.. . 80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT. Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so. barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,. until we see the residue of man\\'s presence on the landscape: ruined. quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,. half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than. husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a. rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.. . A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden. RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue. light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift. in the sky and descends gently to earth.. . The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once. more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town. of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was. once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long. mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.. . A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We. MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY. It\\'s twenty-odd years ago, and we\\'re looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN. -- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie. and a white lab coat.  He\\'s at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing. a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:. . JANEY SLATER (O.S.). Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You\\'d think they. could at least make us a decent hamburger.. . JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He\\'s utterly smitten. with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she\\'s a couple. of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just. close enough to LAURIE that you\\'d notice the resemblance.  And she\\'s. probably the only one in the room who can\\'t see just how bad a crush. JON has on her.. . JON. I\\'ll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I\\'m gonna. head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.. . JANEY. With lots of ketchup?. . Smiling, she indicates JON\\'s plate.  He\\'s emptied at least half a. bottle on his french fries.. . JON. Nothing wrong with ketchup.. . JANEY. Jon Osterman, you don\\'t act like a Princeton boy.  What\\'s a big lug. like you doing in a place like this?. . JON. Anything for science, I guess.. (long, hesitant pause). Janey, there\\'s something --. . JANEY. (simultaneously). We should get back --. (realizing she\\'s cut him off). What?. . JON. Nothing.  What were you going to say?. . JANEY. We should get back to the lab.. (staring at him; chuckling). You okay, Jon?. . He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he. pipes up:. . JON. Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I\\'ll be right behind you.. . The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads. for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after. JANEY.  She\\'s paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.. . His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up. behind her.. . JANEY. Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --. . JON. (blurting it out). Janey, will you marry me?. . She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He\\'s wearing the. pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the. verdict.. . JANEY. Jon -- what?. . JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes. locked.  For a moment it\\'s as if they\\'re the only souls in the. canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the. door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and. one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled. JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.. . There\\'s a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private. trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.. . WALLY. Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.. . JANEY. Oh Wally, don\\'t feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --. . JON. I can fix it.. . JANEY. -- What?. . JON. My dad\\'s a watchmaker.  I\\'ll put it back together for you.  Better. than ever.. . He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.. . WALLY. Take him up on it.  It\\'d make me feel better.. . Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY. hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her. with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he\\'s still waiting for his. answer.. . But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.. He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY\\'s hands --. . JON. Here.  I\\'ll trade you.. . -- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.. With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but. he\\'s already gone.. . She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.. . 82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY. JON\\'s at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center. of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER\\'S. TOOLS.. . It\\'s his lunch hour, and he\\'s fixing JANEY\\'s watch.  He tightens the. central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal. into its housing and gives it a light tap.. . With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy\\'s in love,. remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed. with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST. CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of. it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like. anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.. . He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and. walks over to grab it.  As he\\'s putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK. from the direction of the test chamber.. . Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,. seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it\\'s 13:58 and change.  JON. eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to. the reinforced steel door of the chamber.. . Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a. low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it. hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY\\'s watch on the. concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.. . JON. C\\'mon, little guy, outta here . . .. . The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in. hand.. . JON (cont.). . . . don\\'t wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.. . He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he\\'s left the watch. inside.. . He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.. Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the. doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of. the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete. block, reaches for the watch --. . -- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.. . White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete. block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of. the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.. . Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --. TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.. . He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps. sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams. shut.. . 83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT. 1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One. of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of. MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the. facilities.. . SCIENTIST. -- actually, we don\\'t know what happens when you disrupt the. intrinsic field.  All we\\'ve managed to do so far is blow a few. concrete blocks all to hell.. . GENERAL. (joking, but worried). No danger of . . . fallout, is there?. . SCIENTIST. No sir.  The chamber\\'s radiation-proof once it\\'s sealed.  That\\'s why. we waited outside.. . The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a. dull red.. . The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There\\'s a dim, distant. THUMPING.. . The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect. unison.. . GENERAL. What\\'s the matter?. . SCIENTIST. Sweet Jesus -- !. . We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of. the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the. terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,. screaming soundlessly.. . Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,. punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes. to a belated and painfully obvious realization:. . GENERAL. Say, there\\'s a man in there!!. . The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One. SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --. . SCIENTIST I. Stay calm, Jon!  We\\'ll try and kill the power!. . -- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:. . SCIENTIST II. Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman\\'s trapped in the I.F.. chamber!!. . The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.. . GENERAL. Well -- why doesn\\'t someone let him out??. . SCIENTIST III. It\\'s a timelock.  It can\\'t be opened once the sequence. starts.. (to SCIENTIST II). What\\'s the word?. . SCIENTIST II. (covering the phone). They\\'re sending a crew to the generator building --. . SCIENTIST IV. TWENTY SECONDS!. . In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN. CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon\\'s friend from the. canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the. glass, and grabs the ax.. . SCIENTIST I. Wally!  What are you doing?. . WALLY. The power cables!!. . And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY. SLATER.. . JANEY. Am I late for the --. . She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the. lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back. through the door.. . SCIENTIST III. Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!. . But she resists.  She\\'s just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to. take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils. have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.. . JANEY. What in the name of -- where\\'s Jon?. . SCIENTIST III. Janey!  Please!  Go!!. . WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a. sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a. wall.. . Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white. light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look. at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.. . JANEY. Jon.. . 84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT. JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his. face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,. which he\\'s been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .. . .. . . . . and everything in the room goes blue.. . 85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT. The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to. tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind. them.. . JANEY. Jon . . .. (shrieking). JON!!!. . 86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT. JON\\'s back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of. unbelievable agony.. . A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a. photographic negative -- stands in his place.. . Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The. iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to. pieces.. . And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,. and we\\'re looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of. the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,. who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT. The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall. behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago. at 11:48 PM.. . For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches. the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the. door of the canteen.. . 88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT. DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.. . 89. INT. MEN\\'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT. TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into. the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous. thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal. cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous. system.. . They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in. a haze of shimmering blue light.. . 90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT. DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.. . 91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT. HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A. partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS. for several seconds before vanishing altogether.. . 92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT. DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.. . 93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT. Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.. . JANEY. I can\\'t help it.  I\\'m going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it. feels haunted.. . WALLY. It\\'ll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that\\'s all.. (tugging at his ear). Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?. . Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.. Odder yet, WALLY\\'s hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY\\'s.. Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish. phenomenon.. . UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without. warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW. suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .. . . . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,. nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and. utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.. . JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go. to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.. . JANEY. JON-N-N-N!!!. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT. THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,. stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and. begins to dig.. . A couple of inches down, he finds what he\\'s looking for: an ancient,. tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and. Janey Slater.  She\\'s holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new. engagement ring.. . His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.. . 95. SERIES OF SHOTS. Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:. . -- JON\\'s black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;. . -- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue. light;. . -- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.. There\\'s a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a. terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .. . -- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom. cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.. . 96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN. Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in. the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at. first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue. starburst a mile above the ground.. . 97. EXT. OUTER SPACE. All at once, we\\'re back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth. at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on. toward Mars.. . The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame. as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.. Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:. vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.. Herschel\\'s famous canali.  And finally, the argyre. planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling. two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular. ridge.. . Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a. happy-face.. . Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian. atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we. . CUT TO:. . 98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN. The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN\\'s press conference.. As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on. his angered face:. . DR. MANHATTAN. I said leave me alone!!. . Then there\\'s a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same. positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they\\'re all standing on. the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.. . PULL BACK TO:. . 99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT. A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.. She\\'s in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the. big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy. furnished studio.. . TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.). -- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported. a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania. Avenue!. . TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.). Well, Katie, I know some politicians who\\'d like to learn that trick --. . LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,. SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.. . SCHMIDT. All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.. . LAURIE. Am I free to go?. . SCHMIDT. You\\'re free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let\\'s move. it.. . LAURIE. (fed up; exploding). I don\\'t know why you\\'ve been keeping me here, but you\\'re in deep shit. --. . SCHMIDT. Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan. border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living. soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic. weapons has finally flipped out.. . LAURIE. Jon??  You mean he\\'s --. . SCHMIDT. That\\'s right.  Your meal ticket\\'s flown the coop.  That blue bastard. has apparently left the planet.. . CUT TO:. . 100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY. The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:. . DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH. Russian Tanks Advance. President Vows \"Maximum Force\". WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?. . And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS. VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:. . NEWS VENDOR. I\\'ll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,. bombs, ICBM\\'s!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a. bitch --. . CUSTOMER. Anyone ever tell you you\\'re full of shit?. . NEWS VENDOR. Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!. . VOICE. New Frontiersman, please.. . The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old. friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.. He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under. the counter.. . NEWS VENDOR. Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.. (beat). Well, I see the world ain\\'t ended yet.. . The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  \"EXPOSED: RED. PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!\". . STREET CRAZY. . . . How do you know?. . CUT TO:. . 101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT. A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A. DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight. WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and. off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging. tipsy giggles.. . 102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT. A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN. ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;. his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --. we\\'ll call him MOLOCH.. . MOLOCH. Now.  What was milady drinking?. . LUCY. Gin.  Straight up --. (mock-ladylike). . -- with a little twist of lime.. . She laughs convulsively, as if she\\'s just told the world\\'s funniest. joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:. . MOLOCH. I think I can oblige.. . 103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The. contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen. floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It\\'s a. disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in. the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.. . LUCY. Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?. . On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.. He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen. table.. . RORSCHACH. Moloch.  Did you miss me?. . LUCY. Willie!  Jesus!  What\\'s going on?. . RORSCHACH. (glancing up). Who\\'s the welfare mother?. . MOLOCH. I don\\'t know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong. guy.. . RORSCHACH. Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.. . MOLOCH. You\\'re making a big --. . RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against. the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.. . RORSCHACH. Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.. . MOLOCH. ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How\\'d you find me?. . LUCY. Willie, what\\'s he talking about?. . RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.. RORSCHACH kneels beside him.. . MOLOCH. Look, I don\\'t know what you want, but I been a private citizen for. ten years.  I --. . RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH\\'s chin and pulls him. close.  Then, for LUCY\\'s benefit, he explains:. . RORSCHACH. Turned state\\'s witness in \\'75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.. (twisting MOLOCH\\'s head to one side, for a better look). Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.. . He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There\\'s a sugar. bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as. MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who\\'s. behind it?. . MOLOCH. Rorschach, you\\'re talkin\\' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with. --. . RORSCHACH. Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.. . MOLOCH. CTU?  Jesus.  You don\\'t think --. . RORSCHACH. Don\\'t know.  Ask around.  I\\'ll be back.. . LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH\\'s side and grips his arm as. RORSCHACH opens a rear window.

With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the. table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined. and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he\\'s none other than. that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at. 74.. . PRESIDENT (cont.). Good God.  At times like this I wish I\\'d never come out of. retirement.. . CUT TO:. . 105. INT. DOCTOR\\'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY. A private practice in midtown Manhattan.

You and me, seeing each. other, someone might put two and two together . . .. . LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.. . LAURIE. They\\'re not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon\\'s gone, we\\'re. right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the. Watchmen.. . DREIBERG. Maybe not, but why take chances?. . LAURIE. Dan, what are you so scared of?

I\\'m finally free to, to go out and live my own. life, and --. . -- and she\\'s dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a. damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts. to get up.. . LAURIE. I\\'m just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I\\'d better go find. myself a cheap room.. . DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the. door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and. chases her down:. . DREIBERG. Laurie, wait.  I\\'ve got a spare room.  It\\'s empty.  If you\\'d like . .. .. LAURIE. Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn\\'t.  You\\'d just be all nervous about --. . DREIBERG. No, screw that.

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the. street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of. frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of. ketchup.. . He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down. question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he. opens it again, he\\'s got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.. . 107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET. A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,. then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls. casually down the alleyway.. . He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the. crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a. small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a. shifting INKBLOT MASK.. . 108. INT. DREIBERG\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:. flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.. It\\'s small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as. DREIBERG ushers her in.. . LAURIE. This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.. . DREIBERG\\'s lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands. there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.. . LAURIE (cont.). Are you . . . waiting for a tip?. . DREIBERG. Oh.

Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it\\'s SILK SPECTRE --. LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off. valiantly, but she\\'s heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.. . An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into. frame; he\\'s clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP. overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE\\'s path and. snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.. . 112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG..

Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in. an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and. crewcut.  He\\'s got a definite CTU look about him.. . MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA. DINER.. . 114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER. A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and. pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the. nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges. of his EYELIDS.. . His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;. bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it. up . . .. . There\\'s a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.. . A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and. sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.. . He GASPS and lunges for the door.

He\\'s walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES. -- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.. . 124. INT. DREIBERG\\'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG\\'s stereo: an old Fats Waller. tune, \"S\\'posin\\'.\"  He\\'s slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces. illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile. she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt. pocket.. . Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making. him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her. hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so. that he can\\'t avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on. his mouth.. .

RORSCHACH crouches in the. hallway just outside the living room.. . The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH. strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --. creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the. puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF. BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.. . \"S\\'posin\\' I should say for you I yearn . . .. (Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.). Would you think I\\'m speaking out of turn? . . .\". . 128. INT.

The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from. the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov. cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.. .

Would you think I\\'m speaking out of turn . . .\". . The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He. steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their. weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.. . The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as. RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.. . 135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT.

Someone tried to kill Adrian.. (beat). . . . First time I\\'ve ever heard him scared.. . He doesn\\'t say any more than that.  He doesn\\'t have to.

Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --. . Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH. picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The. smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.. . GOON I. Didn\\'t know he was such a tiny little thing.. . GOON II. Little?  Naw, he\\'s a big man.  Big man.. .

Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III\\'s head with the edge of. his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III. follows.. . The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving. counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings. a KNEE up into GOON II\\'s chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I\\'s hair, and. tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I\\'s head, face down,. into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.. . Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I\\'s hair, RORSCHACH. uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER\\'s gut.  GOON. II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby. burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with. HOT COOKING FAT.. . All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two. disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked. and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in. with billy clubs drawn.. .

A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --. delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of. the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are. totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal. doors.. . At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,. then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of. RORSCHACH.. . TRUSTY. Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they\\'re dyin\\'. man.. (beat). Their friends are talkin\\' \\'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .. this whole place blows.. .

LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a. square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED. WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.. . Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across. the table for RORSCHACH\\'s inspection.  It\\'s the same series of. inkblots as before, the \"butterfly\" leading off.  But this time, the. subject has decided to cooperate:. . RORSCHACH. A whore fucking.. . DR. LONG. Who is she?  Do you know her?. . Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the \"nice. flowers\":. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Man\\'s guts.  Falling out of his shirt.. .

RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.. . DR. LONG. So the rest of the world is wrong, and you\\'re right.  Is that it?. (no response). You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why. would you want to kill a dog?. . With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:. . RORSCHACH. One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.. . 147.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.). Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.. . He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO. HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen. object.. . 148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK). A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,. flicks on a flashlight.. . Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The. light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders. over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and. on the floor, a ROPE.. . There\\'s a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,. sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a. charred scrap of FABRIC from a child\\'s pajamas, decorated with. balloons and teddy bears.. . He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden. CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding. paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher\\'s. knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh. WINDOW.. . RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.). Dogs wouldn\\'t shut up.  That\\'s when I knew where the little girl had. gone.. . 149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK).

RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the. story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his. reply, asks:. . DR. LONG. Then what happened?. . RORSCHACH. . . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had. to break in.. . 152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK). The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He\\'s. handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a. GROCERY SACK.. . He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off. his glove and reaches into the sack.. . FAT MAN. What -- what are you d--. . RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER. into his open mouth.  He\\'s got several pounds of the stuff, and he. spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN\\'s face,. throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he\\'s. done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER. BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN\\'s head.. . FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,. and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs. inside.. . Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.. . 153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY. DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things. up.. . RORSCHACH. When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their. skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.. (leaning forward). See, God didn\\'t kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed. her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,. he did\\'t seem to mind.. . DR. LONG. That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --. . RORSCHACH. Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn\\'t make. it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.. (slight smile). What else can I illuminate?. . LONG\\'s had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the. PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he. points a finger at LONG\\'s inkblot.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .. just a man\\'s face.. (pause). See it now?. . The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a. couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a. second he reaches for his briefcase; as he\\'s gathering his cards, he. STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern. on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.. . LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the. Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 154. EXT.

She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull. it back to reveal . . .. . THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL\\'s high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It\\'s a bit. tarnished from years of disuse, but it\\'s still an impressive sight.. DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around. to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.. . LAURIE. The Owlship.  I can\\'t believe it.. . DREIBERG. -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.. . 156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on. the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,. reliving days gone by.. . LAURIE. Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?. . DREIBERG. I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some. cows.  -- I wonder if she\\'d make it down to Antarctica.. . LAURIE. Antarctica??. . DREIBERG. Adrian\\'s headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come. along.. (pause). I\\'ve been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn\\'t be a. bad place to sit out a war.. . LAURIE. Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be. left.. . DREIBERG. You and me.. . He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her. gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the. cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly. rejected.. . DREIBERG. . . . Yeah, you\\'re right.  Probably wouldn\\'t make it down there. anyway.. . Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She\\'s just. opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES. -- their old superhero togs.. . LAURIE. Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can\\'t believe you kept them.. . DREIBERG. Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.. (chuckling). The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can\\'t.  Helping. people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don\\'t. know.  It all seems so abstract.. . LAURIE\\'s holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing. herself in a small mirror above a sink.. . LAURIE. God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.. . DREIBERG. What are you up to?. . LAURIE. Don\\'t look.  Turn around.. . Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the. cabin.. . DREIBERG. This\\'d better not be what I think it is.. . LAURIE. Okay!. . DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE\\'s in full costume, looking quite. imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns. shock:. . DREIBERG (cont.). My God, it\\'s the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender. of the weak!. . LAURIE. In the flesh.. . She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,. and strokes his thinning hair.. . LAURIE (cont.). Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don\\'t you.. . DREIBERG.

There\\'s a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless. motions stylized and surreal.  They\\'re beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as. the Owlship\\'s powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy. equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --. . -- and suddenly, the footage we\\'re watching undergoes a SUBTLE. TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the. action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we\\'re in. full-color and real-time --. . 163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP. -- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the. Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.. Seaport!. . 164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.. . DREIBERG. Okay Laurie, let\\'s see if we\\'ve still got what it takes.. . On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.. . 165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT. A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.. . CTU RADAR MAN. Sir, we\\'ve got an odd blip off starboard . . .. . The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --. . 166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT. -- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured. ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets. sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against. the water.. . 167. ANGLE ON CROWD. pointing at the skies in disbelief.. . VOICE IN CROWD. LOOK!  UP THERE!. . VOICE IN CROWD II. Oh my God, it\\'s --. . . 168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG. He barks into a microphone:. . DREIBERG. Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --. . 169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK. Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the. OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:. . OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER. -- or we\\'ll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!. . CTU LOUDSPEAKER. UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.. . OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER. BABY . . . WE\\'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.. . The crowd\\'s in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But. a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the. strange sight overhead.. . VOICE IN CROWD. . . . IT\\'S THE WATCHMEN!!. . EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,. clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging. immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West. showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate. into position.. . 170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.. . DREIBERG. We\\'re gonna have to shave this one close.. . An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle. FULL-FORWARD.. . 171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP. With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS. CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond. before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES. FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD. CHEERS.. . 172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the. aft view from the ship.. . LAURIE. They\\'re following us.. . DREIBERG. All right.  Mission accomplished.. . He\\'s no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the. ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.. . 173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT. The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU. SHIPS rip past on either side.. . 174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT. ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The. OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE. blows a HOLE in its facade.. . 175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP. firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.. . 176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar. readout:. . LAURIE. Missed \\'em Dan.  You\\'re aiming high!. . DREIBERG. I don\\'t want to take \\'em out.  Just want to keep \\'em interested.. . LAURIE. (checking the monitor). They\\'re practically on us . . .. . DREIBERG. That Detroit shit?  I\\'m so worried.. . He punches a button on the dash.  It\\'s labelled \"TURBO.\". . 177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP. The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving. the CTU craft in the dust.. . 178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT. A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,. and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.. . A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The. less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and. EXPLODES. . The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last. moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP. ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles. for the airborne route.. . 179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER. The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the. cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.. . There\\'s an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges. UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS. against the roof of the tunnel.. . 180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.. . DREIBERG. Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.. . 181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT. The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an. almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its. wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --. but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward. on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the. water.. . 182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. They\\'re in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of. intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.. . LAURIE. We lost him.. . He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she. shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.. . LAURIE (cont.). Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.. . FADE THROUGH TO:. . 183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT. The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving. line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall. and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of. him.. . TRUSTY. Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.. . The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes. through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,. it\\'s reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named. T-BONE.. . CON IN LINE. Otis went down.. . T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of. SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the. biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:. LITTLE BIGGER.. . T-BONE. Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.. . LITTLE BIGGER. Fuckin\\' Rorschach.. (nodding to himself). This joint goes up.  Tonight.. . 184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT. Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship. emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale. blue moonlight.. . 185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then. disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We\\'re taking a dreamy tour. of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is. singing \"You\\'re My Thrill.\". . Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one\\'s at the. controls.. . The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the. width of the cabin floor.  A woman\\'s hand reaches for it, sets it. right.. . It\\'s LAURIE, who\\'s midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.. The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the. cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.. . LAURIE. Better.  Much better.. . DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile. instead.. . LAURIE (cont.). I bet I know what made the difference this time.. . DREIBERG. What?. . LAURIE. (smirking). The costumes.  Am I right?. . DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite. himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.. . LAURIE (cont.). Come on.  Admit it!. . DREIBERG. No way.  I\\'m not that much of a pervert.. . LAURIE. Yes you are.. . DREIBERG. (drily). No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.. (pause; then, seriously). Tonight was the first time I\\'ve felt like myself in ten years.. . LAURIE. That\\'s because --. . DREIBERG. It\\'s because there\\'s nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world\\'s. about to end.. (a weird smile). I feel like I could save it.. . He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to. the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship. hard right.. . LAURIE. You\\'re full of yourself.  What are you doing?. . DREIBERG. Long as we\\'re on the subject of perverts . . .. (turning to face her). I miss Rorschach.  Let\\'s spring him.. . LAURIE. . . . What??. . DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches. for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.. . 186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT. AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through. the clouds above the city.. . CUT TO:. . 187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON. -- and as Sly Stone once said, there\\'s a riot goin\\' on.  SIRENS HOWL. as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:. disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,. throwing food.. . 188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG\\'s eyes are. riveted to a monitor over the controls:. . DREIBERG. I think we\\'re just a trifle late.. . LAURIE. Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .. . The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below. them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire. with the guards in the watchtower.  It\\'s an ugly, bloody mess.. . DREIBERG. I know he\\'s totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen. times.. . 189. INT. CELL - NIGHT. SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs. drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.. . 190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT. Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past. sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR. MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It\\'s the. psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,. and T-BONE.. . Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop. outside RORSCHACH\\'s cell and GRIN in anticipation.. . LITTLE BIGGER. Find an outlet for this thing. (shouting). Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It\\'s payback time!. . RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying. a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH\\'s. door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.. . CARLOS. See this, runt?  We\\'re gonna take your puny little balls off . . .. and pickle \\'em!!. (chortling). Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!. . HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place. at the panel in the door:. . T-BONE. Lemme see.  Lemme see!. . LITTLE BIGGER. Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.. (to T-BONE). What\\'s he doin\\' now?. . No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed. tightly to the panel.. . LITTLE BIGGER (cont.). You deaf?  I said, what\\'s he --. . He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE\\'s legs buckle and he topples over. backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON. quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye. socket.. . RAFE. BOSS!  JESUS!. . LITTLE BIGGER. Son of a bitch! -- WE\\'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE\\'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE. A GRAPE.. (to RAFE). Light the torch.. . RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of. RORSCHACH\\'s cage.. . 191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT. RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the. inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.. . CUT TO:. . 192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic. EARMUFFS.. . DREIBERG. Okay, I\\'m turning on the screamers.  We\\'ll have to hit the roof. running . . .. . He throws a switch on the control panel.. . 193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH. splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop. their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as. the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .. . 194. INT. RORSCHACH\\'S CELL - THAT MOMENT. The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH\\'S. FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the. wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his. TOILET.. . Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its. mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is. FLOODED.. . 195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER. RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.. . RAFE. Okay, boss, that oughta do it.. . They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER. come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.. . LITTLE BIGGER. WHAT THE --. . RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but. there\\'s no trace of RORSCHACH.. . CARLOS. Rorschach.  Company\\'s calling . . .. . RAFE. Where is the fuckin\\' runt?. . CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his. fist.. . 196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT. In answer to RAFE\\'s question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.. He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO\\'s outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of. the LOCK catches CARLO\\'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .. . . . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,. monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide. and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.. . CARLOS. YOU\\'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --. . From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor. BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --. . -- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --. . -- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do. a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --. . -- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock. DIM and DIE.. . LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down. off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies. of the dead.. . RORSCHACH. Your move . . . runt.. . The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor. as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.. . 197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER. DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to. get their bearings.. . LAURIE. Where are we?  What happened to the lights?. . DREIBERG. Generators\\'ll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .. . .. . Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND. CORRIDOR crosses the one they\\'re standing in.  As they watch, a. SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.. . DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a. familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.. . DREIBERG. . . . Rorschach??. . RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second. and a half -- then keeps on walking.. . 198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER. The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he\\'s just hit a dead end.  He. throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.. Desperate, he ducks into a MEN\\'S ROOM.. . RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,. LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross. corridor.. . LAURIE. Rorschach!  Is that you??. . He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and. dispassionate, he enters the MEN\\'s room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand. at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.. . LAURIE. What\\'s he doing?. . DREIBERG. I think he\\'s going to the john.. . LAURIE. My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and. he stops to take a --. . Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a. paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a. \"howdy.\". . DREIBERG. . . . That was quick.. . RORSCHACH. Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.. (beat). Let\\'s get out of here.. . CUT TO:. . 199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT. A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky. Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.. . Air Force One is coming in for a landing.. . 200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER. Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling. about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.. . SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and. what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal. ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON\\'s in the passenger seat, and there\\'s an. imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating. a long stay.. . PRESIDENT NIXON. Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?. . SECRETARY LIDDY. She\\'s all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right. away.. . LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless. corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.. . SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.). Weatherman says we\\'re lookin\\' good.  We\\'ve got a fourteen-hour. window.. . PRESIDENT NIXON. Fourteen hours, huh?. . SECRETARY LIDDY. Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.. . CUT TO:. . 201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT. LAURIE\\'s following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen. . . .. . NEWSCASTER. -- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place. the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --. . . . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control. console, occupied by other matters.. . DREIBERG. I don\\'t know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.. . RORSCHACH. Veidt\\'s a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his. mangy cat on me.. . DREIBERG. What new information?. . RORSCHACH. Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan. somehow involved . . .. (scratching his chin). . Strange that no one\\'s tried to attack you, Daniel.. . There\\'s an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,. highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.. . DREIBERG. I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.. . LAURIE. Will you two lovebirds keep it down?. . Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at. the monitor LAURIE\\'s watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the. screen:. . NEWSCASTER. . . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was. unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the. Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.. . RORSCHACH. \"Ozone layer\"?. . DREIBERG. (rolling his eyes). Christ.  Couldn\\'t he just admit that he\\'s scared??. . CUT TO:. . 202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT. The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of. pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous. strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered. around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is. one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT\\'s Antarctic retreat.. . 203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT. The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian. style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad. figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered. LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.. One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a. silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back. of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.. . LACKEY. Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.. . VEIDT. Feed Bubastis.  I\\'ll have dinner when I\\'ve looked in on the world.. . They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him. to:. . 204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT. The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated. REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,. RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.. . VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal. a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,. picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It\\'s far more. informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,. a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in. and his eyes begin to rove.. . 205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL. PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,. sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\". VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER\\'S VOICE. comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense. logo . . .. . BBC NEWSCASTER. -- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as. possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter. can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --. . FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT\\'s gaze drifts several screens to. the right, to the monitor labelled \"WASHINGTON D.C.\"  Sound up:. . NEWSCASTER. -- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have. already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen. insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing. negotiations --. . FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the. bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT\\'s antarctic. retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new. angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are. clear.  FLICK --. . -- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we\\'re. watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from. twenty-some years ago; he\\'s sitting at a table in the Gila Flas. canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he\\'s getting ready to. propose.. . 206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT. eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.. . CUT TO:. . 207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT. LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.. On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.. . 208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT. DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of. the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,. gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It\\'s been cordoned off,. POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.. . DREIBERG. They\\'ve got my building surrounded.. (looking up at her). They must\\'ve been following you all along.. . She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the. accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.. . DREIBERG (cont.). So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.. . LAURIE. Welcome back, Night Owl.. . DREIBERG. What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?. . RORSCHACH. CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.. . DREIBERG. What do you mean, frame-up?. . RORSCHACH. Obvious pattern -- all ties in --. . DREIBERG. Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to. get back at us?. (spreading his hands). What about all those poor shits with cancer?. . TIGHT ON LAURIE, who\\'s listening to all this with mounting. distress.. . RORSCHACH. How do we know they\\'ve got cancer?  Could be part of massive. propaganda scheme . . .. . DREIBERG. Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --. . LAURIE. (interrupting him). It\\'s not.. . RORSCHACH. Not what?. . LAURIE. Not \"propaganda.\". (pause; then, blurting it out --). Christ, I\\'m one of them!  I\\'ve got it.. . DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face. bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her. grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can. think of anything to say.. . Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the. silence.. . RORSCHACH. Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let\\'s get moving.. . 209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT. RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he. pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily. at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers. above.. . 210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.. . LAURIE. I should\\'ve told you, Dan.  I\\'m sorry.  I just wanted things between. us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --. . DREIBERG. It doesn\\'t change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.. . He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up. with tears.. . LAURIE. I love you too, Dan, I -- why don\\'t you give me a minute to get. myself together, okay?. . 211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.. RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of. satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees. DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.. . Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.. . 212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona. resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.. . LAURIE. Jon.  What are you doing here?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'m not here.  I\\'m still on Mars.  I\\'ve come to collect you.. . LAURIE. Collect me?. . DR. MANHATTAN. In the immediate future we\\'re on Mars.  I\\'m telling you goodbye.. You\\'re trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .. . LAURIE. Jon, no -- I can\\'t --. . DR. MANHATTAN. It will happen, Laurie.  I\\'ve already seen it.  Neither of us. can do anything to change it.. . DREIBERG\\'s frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside. the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.. MANHATTAN\\'s hand.. . DREIBERG. LAURIE!  DON\\'T --. . Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and. LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.. . Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There\\'s obviously nothing he can. do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.. . RORSCHACH. Where\\'s Laurie?. . DREIBERG. I don\\'t think she\\'s coming with us.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT. A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian. surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later. LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,. then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red. sands.. . DR. MANHATTAN\\'s gone several paces before he realizes there\\'s a. problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at. the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back. and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by. a HALO OF OXYGEN.. . DR. MANHATTAN. The atmosphere.  I\\'m sorry.  These things slip my mind.. . LAURIE. Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --. . Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she. stops in her tracks.. . Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN\\'s new abode: a. PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren. sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,. surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and. pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering. crystalline castle.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I live here now.. . He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after. him.. . CUT TO:. . 214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT. TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the. glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.. . RORSCHACH. Heading south.  What\\'s the plan?. . DREIBERG. We\\'re running, Rorschach.  We\\'ve got no place to go.  We\\'re. hightailing it down to Adrian\\'s.. . RORSCHACH. Veidt\\'s assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can\\'t just --. . DREIBERG. (exploding). Cases, leads -- they don\\'t matter, Rorschach.  The world\\'s about to. end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn\\'t. matter.. . RORSCHACH. Coward.  Giving up.. . DREIBERG. SHUT UP, Rorschach.. . RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.. . RORSCHACH. Sorry, Daniel.  You\\'ve always been a good friend.  I know that.. (pause). Sorry about Laurie.. . DREIBERG. (choked voice). Okay, let\\'s just . . . thank you.. . For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can\\'t leave well. enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.. . RORSCHACH. Veidt\\'s not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.. . CUT TO:. . 215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\\'S PALACE - NIGHT. LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals. around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the. enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING. -- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.. . LAURIE. This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you\\'ll tell me. you\\'re sleeping with Dreiberg.. . LAURIE. You -- you know about me and Dan?. . He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I\\'ll. finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.. . LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.. . LAURIE. Jon, does anybody know what the hell you\\'re talking about?. (flustered). Dan\\'s just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks. at me he\\'s seeing something more than just a -- a collection of. atoms.. . DR. MANHATTAN. (startled). Then you\\'re sleeping with Dreiberg?. . LAURIE. Well, I just, you just said -- don\\'t act surprised.. . DR. MANHATTAN. That\\'s how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even. my responses.. (nodding). We\\'re all puppets.  I\\'m just a puppet who can see the strings.  --. Thirty seconds.. . She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle. of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles. below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent. WIND whips across their faces.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'ll be here for the next year or so.  Then I\\'m going to work my way. out toward the edge of the universe.. (staring out at the landscape). Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn\\'t it beautiful?. . She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and. fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and. frightened.. . LAURIE. Jon -- there\\'s something I have to know.  Did you love me. once?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.. . LAURIE. Yet you must\\'ve known all along that you\\'d give me cancer.  Just be. being with me.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I didn\\'t give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don\\'t. know what did.. . LAURIE. But you knew that I\\'d -- die.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Memories of the future are just like any others.  I\\'ve tried not to. dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .. (pause). You won\\'t die of cancer, Laurie.  There won\\'t be time for that.. . LAURIE\\'s blood runs cold as she realizes what he\\'s telling her.. . LAURIE. Then it\\'s going to happen.  The world\\'s going to end.  -- And you\\'ve. always known.. . DR. MANHATTAN. (nodding). Always.  Ever since the day I died.. . He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the. forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in. her hands.. . DR. MANHATTAN (cont.). Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it\\'s been like for me. these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be. destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless. agent of its destruction?. . LAURIE. (sobbing). Then why don\\'t you . . . do something about it!. . DR. MANHATTAN. Because --. . LAURIE. Because you can\\'t, I know, it\\'s preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.. (angrily). Jon.  This, this \"script\" you\\'re following . . . who writes it?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I don\\'t know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six. hundred years.. . That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the. shoulders:. . LAURIE. I can\\'t stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I\\'m going to. die I want to be with -- other people.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I\\'ve got eons stretching before me, a. universe to explore.  I\\'ll be alone.. (reaching for her hand). You\\'re the last human being I\\'ll ever see.. . CUT TO:. . 216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT. The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south. Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and. begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .. . 217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.. Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH\\'s taken a bad. tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:. . RORSCHACH. What happened?. . DREIBERG. The guidance system\\'s fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some. kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.. . RORSCHACH. What caused it?. . DREIBERG. Don\\'t know.  Nothing I can think of --. (apprehensively). -- outside of a nuclear blast.. . DISSOLVE TO:. . 218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT. VEIDT\\'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible. through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.. . 219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT. VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.. . A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.. . 220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT. The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.. . 221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.. . DREIBERG. I¹m taking her down.. (frantically throwing switches). Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --. . The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.. . 222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT. The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.. . A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.. . 223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT. VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.. . As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.. . 224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER. DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:. . VOICE. Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.. . DREIBERG. Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.. . Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.. . DREIBERG (cont.). Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!. . He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.. . RORSCHACH. . . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.. . 225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT. On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.. . The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.. . 226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT. DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.. . DREIBERG. Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.. . RORSCHACH. Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.. . RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.. . RORSCHACH (cont.). Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.. . 227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT. VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.. . TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.. . VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX. growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal\\'s. neck: quiet, girl.. . RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN. FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening. scene.  Suddenly . . .. . RORSCHACH. VEIDT!. . VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;. it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG. backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward. him, TEETH BARED.. . VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a. futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --. part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.. . DREIBERG. Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn\\'t you let us in?. . RORSCHACH. He\\'s the one.  He\\'s been the one all along.  Stalking us.. . DREIBERG. Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --. . VEIDT. Yeah.  See, I\\'ve been working on a little project.  Top secret, of. course . . .. . DREIBERG. The missing scientists.. . VEIDT. Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked. at Gila Flats.. . RORSCHACH. Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .. . VEIDT. Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we\\'ll go save. the world.. . 228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT. Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.. RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping. at his heels.. . VEIDT. Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers. -- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn\\'t Russia.. (tapping his chest). It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill. him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach\\'s capture, my \"assassination\" --. that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting. rid of Dr. Manhattan.. . DREIBERG. What??. . VEIDT. I couldn\\'t let him interfere with my project.. . RORSCHACH. Veidt.  You\\'re the one who started World War III.. . VEIDT. No.  I just hastened the inevitable.. (smiling). He\\'s been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a. little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates. cancer.. . DREIBERG. Laurie?  You\\'re responsible for --. . VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls. out a smoke and strikes it against the box.. . VEIDT (cont.). One thing I\\'ve learned about cancer -- it\\'s much easier to generate. than it is to cure.. . DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the. stun gun across DREIBERG\\'s face, knocking him to the floor -- and. LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.. . VEIDT. Let\\'s get something straight.  If you try that again, I\\'ll kill you. without a moment\\'s thought.. . They\\'ve reached the entrance to VEIDT\\'s information room.  200. SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them. inside.. . RORSCHACH. Call off the cat and I\\'ll kill you, Veidt.. . VEIDT. Before you do that, you might want to look at what I\\'ve been looking. at.. . 229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER. VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand. corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila. Flats, reassembling a WATCH.. . DREIBERG. What is this?  It looks like Jon.. . VEIDT. It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.. Manhattan.. . DREIBERG. Good Lord.  How\\'d you get it on tape?. . VEIDT. It\\'s not on tape.  It\\'s live.  We\\'re watching it happen.. . CUT TO:. . 230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN\\'S PALACE - NIGHT. DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,. LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she\\'s. hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On. Mars.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can\\'t die.  It\\'s a. mystery I\\'d like to penetrate.. . LAURIE. Jon, I do not want to hear it.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I\\'m sorry.  Look -- there\\'s a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .. . LAURIE. (shaking her head). Oh God.  I\\'m no more than a bug on a windshield to you.. . DR. MANHATTAN. You\\'re the only human being I care for.. . LAURIE. Then do me a favor.  If the world\\'s going to end, it shouldn\\'t matter. a bit.. (pause). I want you to cure me.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I won\\'t do that.. . LAURIE. You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.. . DR. MANHATTAN. I explained this.  I can\\'t.  That\\'s not the way it happens.. . LAURIE. Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there\\'s anything human left in you. -- then do it.. . Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her. chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.. . Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.. MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he\\'s got to make the. hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .. . A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN. INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian. landscape altogether.. . With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see. the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great. white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the. Martian desert gradually materialize around them.. . The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like. statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what\\'s happened.. . LAURIE. What -- am I --. . DR. MANHATTAN. Cured, yes.. . Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a. handrail for support.  He looks like a man who\\'s just had a heart. attack.. . LAURIE. Jon, what is it?  What\\'s the matter?. . When he looks up at her, he\\'s DESOLATE -- his face filled with. DREAD.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It\\'s all gone blank on. me.  -- I can\\'t remember the future.. . Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around. him.. . LAURIE. Jon.  Let\\'s go back to Earth.. . CUT TO:. . 231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT. VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.. room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring. machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.. . Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON. OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY\\'s watch into. its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching. him from twenty-four years in the future.. . VEIDT. Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.. (pause). Stand back from the field.  It\\'ll blow you to bits.. . DREIBERG. What is it?  How does it work?. . VEIDT. It\\'s a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow. backward in time.. (smiling). There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing. parallel to our own --. . DREIBERG. Adrian -- you\\'ve lost it.. . VEIDT. (pointing at the tachyon bubble). I\\'ve seen them!  I\\'ve seen them in there.. (pause). . In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it. survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.. . He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.. . VEIDT (cont.). The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.. (wild-eyed). Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!. . 232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT. DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.. . LAURIE. We¹re too late.. . DR. MANHATTAN. It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .. . LAURIE. Jon -- what??. . DR. MANHATTAN. The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.. . 233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT. Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.. . VEIDT. At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.. . He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.. . VEIDT. It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.. (turning to face them). In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.. . DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.. . RORSCHACH. . . . And they call me a fucking nut.. . DREIBERG. Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.. . VEIDT. Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?. . DREIBERG. And what if you¹re wrong?. . VEIDT. I¹m not.. . DREIBERG. What if you¹re wrong??. . VEIDT. Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!. (shouting). I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!. . 234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.. . DR. MANHATTAN. That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.. . LAURIE. Jon, where are we?. . DR. MANHATTAN. Veidt¹s complex.. . 235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT. . Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:. . VEIDT. Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years. chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .. as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.. . DREIBERG. You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist. bullshit is going to save the world?. . VEIDT. We\\'d better hope so.  -- It\\'s almost time.. . He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.. Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.. . 236. VEIDT\\'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS. In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears. a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .. . 237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT. A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon. bubble.  There\\'s a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up. --  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT\\'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the. trigger . . .. . . . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.. VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .. . . . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with. LAURIE at his side.. . DR. MANHATTAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?. . VEIDT. Jon!  Get back!  You don\\'t understand.. . DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees. himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of. the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he\\'s. surprised.. . In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to. sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN. THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.. . VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE\\'s directly in his path.  He. shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and. points his STUN GUN directly at her --. . -- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.. . VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --. . VEIDT. NO!!!!. . -- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.. . DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.. . LAURIE. What was he doing?. . DREIBERG. Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --. . DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.. . DR. MANHATTAN. He was right.. . RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.. . DR. MANHATTAN. He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.. . DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.. . LAURIE. Jon --. . DR. MANHATTAN. Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.. . LAURIE. Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?. . DR. MANHATTAN. I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!. . He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz. around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the. room dim; it\\'s as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the. world into his own massive frame.. . DR. MANHATTAN. My work here is finished . . .. . The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to. happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the. test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the. tiny. hole in time.. . He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS. into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND. STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.. . 238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT. JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter. bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling. gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.. . DR. MANHATTAN. Don\\'t be afraid, Jon.  I\\'ll be here with you.. . A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps. forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.. . For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN\\'s frame. surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.. MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the. chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across. the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he. spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding. FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging. with nothingness . . .. . . . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue. light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he\\'s. alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.. . 239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER. The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of. his awed colleagues, who\\'ve seen everything through the observation. panel.. . SCIENTIST. What in the name of God . . .. . The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,. sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As. she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he. looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .. . JON. Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --. . SCIENTIST II. LOOK!!. . The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .. . . which isn\\'t there.  Instead, there\\'s a rippling, irregular. RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are. three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and. RORSCHACH.. . 240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT\\'S LAB - THE PRESENT. DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the. astounded SCIENTISTS.. . LAURIE. What happened -- ?. . DREIBERG. He saved himself.  He changed the past.. . LAURIE. Where did he go?. . Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to. THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For. a moment everything\\'s back to normal --. . -- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they\\'re in begins to. DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.. . A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around. them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge. into . . .. . 241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT. DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an. otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time. could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this. would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;. their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they. know it, they find themselves deposited --. . 242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT. -- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them. materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,. slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the. same, knocking over a fire hydrant.. . LAURIE. Dan, is this -- is this New York??. . DREIBERG. Those cars.  What year is this??. . LAURIE. Everything\\'s changed --. . It\\'s a disorienting world they\\'ve landed in.  In fact, it\\'s. our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,. the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of. whack . . .. . RORSCHACH. Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.. . BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the. obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of. course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden. presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:. Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?. . RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too. close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to. several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection. altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a. shrill WHISTLE.. . DREIBERG. Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!. . 243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT. The same newsstand we\\'ve seen all along -- but luckily, here in our. world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: \"RUSSIAN SUMMIT. TALKS COLLAPSE.\"  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR. is gapin at the ruckus on the street.. . NEWS VENDOR. Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.. . His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to. the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.. . KID. Shit, man!  It\\'s Rorschach!  And Night Owl!. . NEWS VENDOR. What are you talkin\\' about?. . KID. Superheroes!  Check it out!. . He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR\\'s hand and races off to. join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares. down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- \"WATCHMEN\" --. then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the. street.. . KID. All right!  They must be on a case.. . 244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT. HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed. with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived. to clear the streets and restore order.. . COP I. Break it up!  Stand back!. . COP II. Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --. . DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.. They don\\'t know what to expect and they\\'re poised for a brawl.  The. taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant. to advance.. . LAURIE. Dan -- what do we do now?. . DREIBERG. (panicked). Wherever we are, it\\'s better than what we left.  Backs together --. . LAURIE. We\\'ll tell them what\\'s happened.  They\\'ll listen to reason, won\\'t. they -- ?. . RORSCHACH. They\\'d better.. . And on RORSCHACH\\'s final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and. . FADE OUT.. . THE END1Embed',\n \"61 ContributorsDear Future Husband Lyrics[Chorus]. Dear future husband.

I remember the summer Lil\\' Chano got ahold of his household. The\\u200a same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow. Back\\u200a when I could trust in my dogs like Balto.

Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore. Never sold out but now we out-sold. That\\u200a was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors. Learned you get the feds if you can\\'t keep yo\\' mouth closed. That summer left a couple marks like Groucho. That halo can turn hollow, depending how low. That summer left a couple tan lines. I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan. They walk on eggshells and landmines. They communicate with handsigns. . [Chorus: Ben Gibbard]. Do you remember how when you were younger.

With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends. So, tell them I'll be here. Right next to the boy who's throwin' up. 'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more. Oh God, why am I here?. .

Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator. Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none. How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this. So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done. I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'. And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way. So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready. And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low. Yo, I'll be over here. [Chorus]. Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here.

My three questions are:. 1) If there had been one more Oasis album after Dig Out Your Soul, what do you think it would\\'ve been like? Which songs of yours or the other three would you have put on it?. 2) What\\'s your maddest Oasis story?. 3) What lead to Lock All the Doors being dug up and rerecorded for Chasing Yesterday? And,while we\\'re on the subject, are there any odds in any other old and unreleased songs being redone for future releases? I would love to hear a finished version of Gotta Have Fun from the \\'89 tape. Cheers Noel!\". NG: \"1.) Okay. It would\\'ve been half of my first solo record, so \"Record Machine\" would\\'ve probably been on it... \"Stop the Clocks\" would\\'ve probably been on it, and \"Dream On\" and maybe \"Stranded on the Wrong Beach\" and then the rest of the guys would\\'ve put on some of their own songs. 2.) Hah. Wow. Maddest Oasis story. Just the fact that we existed AT ALL and became the biggest band in the world is bizarre enough. I\\'m not going to share any Oasis stories with anybody online for fear of litigation and libel. Although needless to say - there were oiled midgets involved. grins. There, I\\'ve said too much. 3.) \"Gotta Have Fun?\" What led to \"Lock All the Doors\" being resurrected was just the fact that I kept the chorus in my head all those years... and I just happened to be comin\\' out of the local supermarket, on a Sunday evening... and snaps fingers it fell out of the sky. That\\'s it. There are no more hidden gems to be regurgitated. Good word. Regurgitated. \"Gotta Have Fun?\" Don\\'t remember that one.\". . Question 12:. Ruben122: \"Hi Noel.

I love the new album, and I can\\'t describe how happy I am that you finished Lock all the Doors. Your music, especially the Masterplan album and your first solo album has been the amazing soundtrack to my teenage years and helped me through some really rough times. Do you have any plans to release songs such as \"Bye Bye My Family/Don\\'t Stop Being Happy,\" \"She Must Be One of Us\" or \"Just Let it Come Down Over Me\"?. The Mustique Demos are something of a \"Holy Grail\" among Oasis fans. Will they be released with the Be Here Now reissue?. To get a response from you would be incredible, and again thank you for all the incredible music.\". . NG: \"Okay. There will be a \"Be Here Now\" reissue. The Mustique Demos will be on it. Indeed. The 3 songs that you mentioned - \"Bye Bye My Family\" is called \"Don\\'t Stop...\" - the other two will definitely be released at some point - not sure when.\". . Question 14:. Thefatronaldo: \"Should City sack Pellegrini this summer and if so who would you like to see in charge next?\". . NG: \"Should they sack \\'im, I don\\'t know. Who should they get?

Laurakd7: \"Do you get up to Manchester much these days and do you prefer London now?\". . NG: \"Eh - I go to Manchester to see my football team, Manchester City. When I go there, I love it. I usually spend about 2 or 3 nights there, at a time, and it\\'s great, but London has become my home. And it\\'s where I will probably stay from now on.\". . Question 17:.

Because he\\'s mean, and evil. My favourite wrestler at the moment is Bray Wyatt. Because we met him when they did a show in London, and he was a really fucking nice guy. And we met Hulk Hogan, and he was a REALLY fucking nice guy. He asked if I was one of his Hulkamaniacs, and I had to say \"yes, of course!\" He came into this room, and I was going \"Look Donovan, it\\'s Hulk Hogan\" and he goes \"Look BROTHER, are you one of my Hulkamaniacs?!\" and I said \"Yes, of course!\". .

NG: \"gestures with ring. Thank you very much. I bought this ring in a pawn shop in Tokyo in the 90\\'s. It\\'s a US college ring that I believe people get when they graduate from college in America. It was given to somebody. I\\'m assuming a G.I. stationed in Tokyo, from Ruston High School in Mississippi (I\\'ve looked it up). It has started many a boring conversation with some of the American armed forces in airport lounges across the world, when they\\'ll say to me \"Where\\'d you go to school buddy?\". \"Manchester?\". \"I see you got a ring there. Where\\'d you go to school?\". \"I went to Ruston High School in Mississippi, as you can tell by my accent.\"\". . Question 22:.

And then I finish with \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyonce. Chuckles\". . Question 23:. Gusrodlopez: \"How was life before Oasis? did you had any life goal or something?\". . NG: \"No, where I came from, and the times that I grew up in, it was best not to have any ambitions. It was quite a bleak time. I never had a life goal until I wrote \"Live Forever.\" And then when I wrote \"Live Forever,\" I wanted to be in the biggest band in the world.\". . Question 24:. Riceomatic69: \"Hey Noel, always wanted to ask this....back in the 90\\'s you worked with Epiphone on your signature model \"Supernova\" guitar. However it didn\\'t have any of the details of the custom shop Union Jack Epiphone you were most famous for at the time & have never seen any footage of you playing one. Did you have much involvement in the design or was it just a nice big bag of cash handed over for the use of your signature? :)\". . NG: \"chuckles. Okay, FIRSTLY, there was no big bag of fucking cash. Secondly, I was involved in the design. Thirdly, I can\\'t fucking remember what my involvement was. Fourthly, I do have one, somewhere. But... I shouldn\\'t have made them sonic blue color. It\\'s disgustin\\'. Tell her I was high on the time, on drugs.\". . Question 25:. Bonojour: \"Will there ever be a song featuring Boots? I think the meows would be a great harmony.\". . NG: \"chuckles. Eh...Boots is an arrogant little shit. Yeah. That\\'s my cat. He\\'s been ignoring me for the last fucking five years. Me and Boots could never work together. There would be too many \"artistic differences.\". . Question 26:. Venomousvillainy: \"Hi. My Dad reckons he tested your eyes as a kid, do you remember going to an Opticians in Gorton?\". . NG: \"Gorton?. Yeah...kind of. Well, I know where Gorton is, and I know where my eyes are, and would I have had them tested in Gorton? I don\\'t know. Gorton is like, an area of Manchester near where I used to live.\". . Question 27:. Jyhwkm: \"Noel, you’ve always seemed dismissive of Oasis\\' Be Here Now - Heathen Chemistry years. Why is that? It was the ascots, wasn’t it?\". . NG: \"I dismiss \"Be Here Now\" because it\\'s shit. And I\\'m allowed to say that because I fucking wrote it. \"Heathen Chemistry\" on the other hand, has its moments... \"Force of Nature,\" \"She is Love,\" \"Little By Little,\" \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\" etcetera.

Will we see the 2 of you play together in the near future?\". . NG: \"I was with Gem about 4 weeks ago. Didn\\'t get a chance to talk about anything really. It was at a party I was having in my dressing room, and there were too many people there. But if I needed on a track or a gig that thing that Gem offers, then I wouldn\\'t hesitate to call him because I\\'d still like to think we\\'re good friends and musical partners. As for what he\\'s going to do in the future... I have no idea.\". . Question 30:. PraetorianGuard14: \"Have you seen the new documentary on Kurt Cobain?\". . NG: \"No.\". . Question 31:. Jamesh134: \"Hi Noel, what ever happened to the Oasis version of \"The Roller\"?. Also, I wanted to say thanks for all the music over the years. Been a source of inspiration all my life!\". . NG: \"Oh, thank you very much. The Oasis version of \"The Roller\" is... in somebody\\'s... demo CD collection CD, somewhere. Not mine, I might add. Somebody will have it. Gem will probably have a copy of it. As has Liam, no doubt.\". . Question 32:. Sterlingavenueband: \"Hi Noel. First of all- thank you for the many years of great music and leading me to my first guitar 18 years ago. Forever indebted to you for this. What are your thoughts on the songs \\'Let\\'s All Make Believe\\' and \\'Roll It Over\\' and what are the chances of ever hearing them live? They\\'re amongst two of my favourites of many which have never been done live before. Thanks in advance.\". . NG: \"Eh - \"Roll It Over\" probably will never be performed live. But on the other hand, \"Let\\'s All Make Believe\" I was messing around with it before this tour started, so I wouldn\\'t be surprised if I play it in the very far distant future.\". . Question 33:. ZeppelinYanks: \"Hey Noel! I\\'m a huge fan of Oasis and your solo work. A lot of what made Oasis great was the rock and roll attitude of \"Fuck you, we\\'re the greatest band in the world.\" What do you think about the current state of rock and roll? Is it alive, dead, or dying?\". . NG: \"ponders. I think that rock n\\' roll has turned into - or been turned into - a thing that is now referred to as \"modern rock.\" Which is an awful title to give any kind of music. I think - I just think that the attitude, and the spirit, that we had is definitely disappearing.\". . Question 34:. Rodoalo: \"Hi Noel, it\\'s Rod from URUGUAY. My question has always been this:. Do you have any knowledge of music theory or did you learn songwriting by ear?. Cheers, your new record is amazing.\". . NG: \"I learnt song-writin\\' by ear and instinct. I\\'ve never studied musical theory. I would never allow myself or any of my children to study musical theory. Because if you study musical theory, you will eventually end up soundin\\' like...shit. Hahaha.\". . Question 35:. Riceomatic69: \"You have always spoken very highly of Ryan Adams & his version of Wonderwall, have you ever encountered anybody else that covered one of your tracks & thought it was as good as your version or maybe even better?\". . NG: \"No.\". . Question 36:. Look_who_it_isnt: \"Hi Noel! I\\'m a huge fan. Your music has brought me so much enjoyment over the years - I can\\'t even put it into words. I have major respect and love for you and wish you all the happiness in the world! I have two questions for you:. 1) I love your sense of humor. You always make me laugh :) What\\'s your favorite comedy, either from TV or movies?. 2) A lot of us ladies think you\\'re just the hottest thing ever. Does it bother you to be considered a veritable sex god? ;)\". . NG: \"1.) SEINFELD. The greatest thing that\\'s ever been on television. 2.) It\\'s a cross I have to bear. And unfortunately... you know, it\\'s a long road that I will have to carry this cross down. But I could think of worse things to be. I.E... a French person in Montreal.\". . Question 37:. Loulou96: \"Hi Noel. I heard on radio 1 you perform shows wearing no underwear, can you confirm?\". . NG: \"Yeah, well, clearly that was a joke.\". . Question 38:. Super2goten: \"Hey! Whose names were written on that napkin, Noel?. Thanks for being a legend!

GiovaniGuizzo: \"Hello Mr. Gallagher. Thanks for doing this AmA. I am a huge Oasis\\'s and NGHFB\\'s fan and I actually have several questions, but I will contain myself and ask just 3:. Which music is this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mYMKfuUYc ? It sounds pretty amazing. Would you consider recording it eventually? Can you give us the name of this tune at least?. Have you met the girl of \"Talk Tonight\" after you wrote the song? If you have, how was the meeting?. I loved your new album, specially the \"Lock All the Doors\" track (what a blast from the past). Can we expect other reworked songs from the past in your future albums?. PS: You would like to take a look at /r/oasis. There are some interesting and insightful posts there from some mad fans.\". . NG: \"1.) That song is called \"Don\\'t stop...\" I\\'ve already recorded it. The reason it didn\\'t make it onto \"Chasing Yesterday\" was because it didn\\'t fit the vibe of the album. Needless to say, when I finally get \\'round to releasing it, I think it will be one of my best ever releases. The sound of it is more akin to the first album, and I felt like \"Chasing Yesterday\" had moved on a little bit. But it\\'s a great song, and I love it, and when I finally release it, you\\'re going to love it (fans, that is). 2.) Eh - no, I haven\\'t. I struggle to remember her name, to be honest. 3.) No. That\\'s it now, I\\'m afraid. The cupboards are bare.\". . Question 40:. Rak86t: \"You\\'re a great story teller and have such a way with words. Would you ever consider writing a book?\". . NG: \"looks around room. No.\". . Question 41:. Supersonic5: \"Hey Chief! Never in a million years thought I’d see you do an AMA. You mentioned that you regret the name ‘Chasing Yesterday’, would you change it if you could, and what would you change it to?\". . NG: \"\"Regret\" is too strong a word. I don\\'t think it\\'s the greatest title I ever came up with. But then again, neither was \"What\\'s the Story, Morning Glory.\" If I could change it now, I\\'d probably change it to... eh... \"Dark Side of the Room\". OR \"Wheat is Murder.\" Hahahaha!\". Question 42:. Chenredditdude: \"Hey Noel, I\\'ve noticed that in many songs you play E MINOR... Is it a heavenly chord?\". . NG: \"Hmmm. I guess it must be.\". . Question 43:. Govt_cheeze: \"Hello Noel. How does it feel to be one of the last true rockstars?. &. What do you think of the new Blur album?\". . NG: \"It feels good to be one of the last rockstars. If in fact, that\\'s what I am. And from what I\\'ve heard of the new Blur album, it sounds pretty good.\". . Question 44:. Rpm959: \"What do you think it will take for guitar music to make a comeback?\". . NG: \"Somebody to write some fucking great songs. That\\'s all it\\'ll ever take. That\\'s all it takes. People can talk about \"attitude,\" and \"spirit\" and fucking good-looking guys in bands, and vibe, and fucking blah-blah-blah. I dare ANYBODY from the next generation to write one decent chorus. Yeah. Just one.\". . Question 45:. Justsomepersononredd: \"Hi Noel, huge fan of most of your work. 1) Do you ever get tired of people asking you all kinds of questions about Oasis? I\\'ve watched a few interviews with you post-Oasis and pretty much everyone\\'s asked you a question or two about Oasis, I suppose I\\'m really not being different but do you ever feel like people should just move on?. 2) How has touring and your creative process changed over the years? I mean, the music you put out now is quite different from the start of your career and I\\'m guessing there isn\\'t as much partying behind the scenes as when you started. 3) Which modern-day bands do you listen to nowadays? I discovered Kasabian by watching an interview of you and I think they\\'re amazing, so thanks for that too. 4) Any musicians you\\'d like to collaborate with?. 5) I read that you had another brother, Paul, but I\\'ve never actually heard anything about him. What\\'s he like?. 6) What do you think of all these new forms of music distribution? Itunes, Spotify, Tidal, etc. Thanks for your time, hope you enjoy your AMA, and keep being an awesome musician\". . NG: \"1.) Yes. I do feel like they should move on. But I don\\'t mind answerin\\' the questions if they\\'re from fans, because i know how much that band meant, and continues to mean to people. So in my head, and my heart, I\\'ve moved on. So it\\'s cool. 2.) There\\'s certainly not as much partying in front of the scenes, that\\'s for sure. Everything changes as you get older in life. You know, you don\\'t attempt as much as you did when you\\'re 47 as you did when you were 27 - whether that be length of time on the road, or partying, or amount of songs that you write, or the places you\\'re willing to go to write those songs. The life of a musician in regards to gettin\\' older is just the same as everybody else\\'s life as they get older. Your fucking shit changes. Not literally. 3.) Eh - yes, Kasabian would be one of my favourites. There\\'s a band called Neon Waltz that you should check out. I\\'m not sure... there\\'s a band called Jungle. Fucking hell, they are amazin\\'. Other than that, I\\'m still discovering old stuff from the 60\\'s, I\\'m afraid. 4.) Dave Gillmore, Jeff Beck, Davie Bowie would be - fucking hell, that would blow my mind if he would even shake a maraca for one tune, that\\'d be great. Yeah. 5.) Heh. He\\'s a fucking idiot - I\\'m only jokin\\' - haha! He\\'s a dj. He - when I\\'m on tour in the UK - he does my official after show parties. And he\\'s a funny, funny dude. 6.) I don\\'t agree with streamin\\'. I certainly don\\'t agree with the lack of royalties that I receive from streamin\\'. I realize that the world is changin\\', and the way that people receive music - and even the fact that I use the phrase \"receive music\" is a fucking disgrace. I would rather that people own it. But I\\'m not sure where it\\'s all going to end, if I\\'m being honest. I\\'ll try.\". . Question 46:. Pheelip: \"Hey Noel, huge fan. What do you think has been your greatest musical achievement?\". . NG: \"Whooooooo. I couldn\\'t say with any great sense of certainty, because it changes every day for me, but I\\'m going to say the song \"Rock & Roll Star\" because it sums up everything about bein\\' young, and bein\\' in a band, and the hopes and dreams of, you know, a young land from Manchester. And it\\'s a fucking great song.\". . Question 47:. MadferitNYC: \"Do you think a rock band in 2015 can reach the level of popularity that Oasis reached? Or do you think that the music industry is too dead for there ever to be a rock band that reaches those heights again?\". . NG: \"I think that the days of a rock band explodin\\' out of a council estate in the north of England and going on to connect with so many people in so many countries around the world... I think the chances of that happenin\\' again are very, very slim. But we live in hope.\". . Question 48:. Karmarghh: \"Hey Noel, been a huge fan of yours almost all 20 years of my life. I have been lucky enough to see NGHFB twice recently and just want to tell you the new album is f***ing incredible! You, among the likes of Bacharach and Macca, are my absolute inspiration for pursuing a life in Music, so thanks for that. Anyway - couple questions for you:. . 1) As a songwriter, could you let me in on your approach to melody? I listen to yours and ask myself \"why the bloody hell didn\\'t I think of that?!\". Do they really just pop into your head or do you find there is a lot of trial and error?. . 2) Reckon you can give me a kick-start and replace Mike Rowe with me on keys? He\\'s a cool guy, but I\\'ll do it for nothing. That gives me the edge right? Oh and I won\\'t f*ck it up - I promise!!. . Take it easy Noel, and keep doing what you\\'re doing. Riverman blows my mind.\". . NG: \"1.) Eh - it depends. The great ones usually just pop into your head. And seem to just fall out of the sky. And then some of them you have to work at. There is no golden rule or any rule set in stone for songwritin\\'. No matter what anybody might tell you, it seems to change from song to song for me. But I guess... I always, always, ALWAYS let the melody dictate the rest. I don\\'t worry about the chords. I just let the melody dictate where the song\\'s going to go and sometimes they\\'re great and sometimes they\\'re not. 2.) Well, you\\'re in! Cheap labor is my forte, haha.\". . Question 49:. Sally_cinnamon_: \"Hi Noel! First of all, thanks for giving us so much great music. You truly are a godlike genius. My question for you is: where did your sense of humor and talent for storytelling come from? Because I think you are genuinely one of the funniest people in the world seemingly without even trying. Also, do you still think dogs in hats and sunglasses are hilarious?\". . NG: \"Well - dogs in hats and sunglasses - there is *NOTHING* funnier than a dog in a hat. Ehm - I don\\'t know. My sense of humor, I don\\'t know. It\\'s Irish, it must\\'ve been passed down to me from somebody in Ireland.\". . Question 50:. Jeavo: \"Hi Noel, thanks for doing this AMA. If at all any, what video games do you play?\". . NG: \"I don\\'t play video games. I have a life. And that life is too short for video games. Some of my band play video games on tour. It drives me up the fucking wall. And it\\'s one of the main reasons why I\\'ll probably fire the fucking lot of them on this tour.\". . Question 51:. Shivan21: \"Hi Noel! I\\'ve always wondered about the meaning of D\\'you know what I mean video, and especially the fact that there is Be Here Now and D\\'you know what I mean written in czech language. The video has very 60\\'s atmosphere for me and they are also alluded by Beatles references. Considering the military choppers, could be the video understood as refering to the Prague Spring in 1968?\". . NG: \"No. Okay. The video for \"D\\'You know what I mean\" was shot on the deserted set of FULL METAL JACKET, which is still - you can still visit it in London - so it\\'s an old, disused gasworks in London. The Czech writing, I\\'m not sure what that\\'s all about, I thought it was Vietnamese writin\\'. The choppers was a reference to Vietnam. What any of that has to do with the fucking song is beyond me. I don\\'t even know what the song\\'s about, never mind the video!\". . Question 52:. Brutalful: \"Hi Noel. I am curious what (if anything) is still on your bucket list?. If you have done it all, what are your top 5 moments in life, and is playing with Johnny Marr on that list?. Cheers!\". . NG: \"Okay. First of all - a bucket list is the most fucking ludicrous fucking term I\\'ve ever heard, in my life. BUT. I would like someday to record an album in New York. I would also like to have Dave Gilmore play on a track for me. And Jeff Beck. I think that\\'s about it. Oh, actually, I also still think that one day I\\'m going to write the greatest song in the world.\". . Question 53:. Nathanoasis: \"Hello Noel! Your music is incredible, all 20 years of it, and it has changed my life. Thank you for that and thank you for doing this AMA. I have a question about the song that is going around the Internet under the name \"Bye Bye My Family\" (and \"Don\\'t Stop the Happenin\\'\" and \"Hold Back the Night\"). From what we\\'ve heard, the song sounds amazing. Will this song ever be recorded and released? Thank you again and keep on being an absolute fucking legend!\". . NG: \"chuckles. I pretty much just answered that question about 20 minutes ago. It\\'s a song called \"Don\\'t Stop...\". I\\'ve already recorded it. It didn\\'t make it onto \"Chasing Yesterday\" because it sounded a bit too much like what was already on the first High Flying Birds album. But it will be released, in, you know... soon!\". . Question 54:. MidnightPizza: \"Hello Mr. Gallagher! I\\'d like to thank you for all the music you wrote. I hope to see one of your show soon and maybe pay you a beer. Here are my questions:. 1) Are you still thinking about doing an album with Damon Albarn? What do you think about The Magic Whip, Blur\\'s latest album?. 2) What\\'s your opinion about Dave Sardy\\'s input on your work? Some people think that your latest work (especially your first solo album) could\\'ve been better without him and that producing Chasing Yesterday yourself was refreshing. I personally enjoy the Dave Sardy produced albums as much as any other album you wrote. Anyway, congratulation on Chasing Yesterday. It really is a great album.\". . NG: \"1.) Ehm - the thing with Damon was a flippant comment as casually thrown around as \"We should go for a drink.\" As for makin\\' an album, I would be amazed if either of us ever had the time to make that work. As for \"The Magic Whip,\" I like the tracks \"Lonesome Street\" and \"Ong Ong\" - I haven\\'t heard any of the rest of it, but if those two tracks are anything to go by, sounds like it\\'s going to be good. 2.) Ehm - his input was fantastic. And at the time, invaluable. And I couldn\\'t have got my solo career off the ground without him. All that being said - you know, my record, this record, \"Chasing Yesterday,\" sounds that good. With any producer, it\\'s all about the relationship, as opposed to the skills that they can bring. But me and Dave, you know, still to this day we remain good friends, and maybe we\\'ll work together again in the future.\". . Question 55:. SnakeArms: \"Hi Noel! In ALL of your interviews you\\'ve said that the original verses to \\'Lock All The Doors\\' went to The Chemical Brother\\'s \\'Setting Sun’, which is weird, because the 1993 demos we have suggest that the songs original verses were instead used in \\'My Sister Lover\\' and the verses that went to \\'Setting Sun\\' came from a different demoed song \\'Coming on Strong\\'. Have we missed something or does any of this sound true at all??. Oh, and what happened to \\'Slow\\' and \\'The Red, White & Blue\\'?!\". . NG: \"You should bear in mind that my memory\\'s not the best. If you\\'re telling me it\\'s from a different song, then I would probably agree. I\\'d like to think that the Chemical Brothers story is a better STORY though. So let\\'s keep that between us.\". . Question 56:. LittleWoodstock: \"Hey Noel, big fan of all your work!. Is your work any different with the High Flying Birds than it was with Oasis? Are there any aspects from the Oasis days you miss?\". . NG: \"I miss... the camaraderie of being in a band, in the studio. That is to say, there are massive benefits - by makin\\' a record on your own, you can change direction very very quickly. And you don\\'t have to run things by \"the committee\" of band members. On the other hand, it\\'s great to share, you know... to share the greatness with other people, d\\'you know what I mean? If I can give you an analogy, you know, the more people at a party, the better. Shrugs. Although it\\'s sometimes nice to party on your own.\". . Question 57:. MONTREAL_COME_ON: \"WHY TORONTO AND NOT MONTREAL? we\\'ve got a better hockey club and our football team is getting better every year.\". . NG: \"Because I went to a fucking donut shop once in Montreal, and all the staff spoke French! And last time I looked - France was on the other side of the fucking world. So I say to the people of Montreal - au revoir. Hahahaha!\". . Question 58:. ExtremelySexyMan: \"Hey Noel, first off, huge fan, thanks for doing this. My question is, after writing great songs for more than 20 years now, where do you get your inspiration for new material? I imagine it to be the most difficult part of being a musician, and I am continually blown away by your work. Cheers, and go City!\". . NG: \"Ehm... I guess I\\'m a product of my record collection, which is ever-expanding and gets ever-more eclectic. And I don\\'t ever sit down when I\\'m writin\\' a song and feel like I\\'ve got anything profound to say to the universe... I just - to coin the phrase from that godawful film FROZEN... I just let it go... let it go!. Smiles\". . Question 59:. Stevie_j: \"Noel, thanks for many years of amazing music. Please don\\'t stop. Have you ever thought of doing a comedy tour? Seriously.\". . NG: \"HA!!!!. Fucking hell - NO.\"3Embed',\n '87 ContributorsSuperheroes Lyrics[Hook: Chief Keef]. By myself cause these niggas yes men. Bitch I\\'m Almighty Sosa Batman.

I saved every letter you wrote me. From the moment I read them. I knew you were mine. You said you were mine. I thought you were mine. Do you know what Angelica said. When we saw your first letter arrive?. She said. . “Be careful with that one, love. He will do what it takes to survive.”. You and your words flooded my senses. Your sentences left me defenseless. You built me palaces out of paragraphs. You built cathedrals. I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me. I’m searching and scanning for answers. In every line. For some kind of sign. And when you were mine. The world seemed to. . Burn. Burn. You might also likeYou published the letters she wrote you. You told the whole world how you brought. This girl into our bed.

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy.... Your sentences border on senseless. And you are paranoid in every paragraph. How they perceive you. You, you, you….

The world has no right to my heart. The world has no place in our bed. They don’t get to know what I said. I’m burning the memories. Burning the letters that might have redeemed you.

I hope that you burn94Embed',\n '2 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “Timber” by Pitbul feat. Ke$ha LyricsHi. Rap Critic here. Let\\'s talk about Pitbull…. . So, how do you talk about a rapper who has nothing to say?. . I mean, I can\\'t remember one song from this man that DIDN\\'T talk about being in a club. As far as I remember, his topics range from \"party party party, and drink, drink, drink\" to \"party party party, and drink, drink, drink … but, like, in another country this time!\". Geez, even Sean Paul did a love song every once in a while! And I don\\'t have a problem with party music in general, far from it, it\\'s just that anything involving Pitbull\\'s music has a very… processed feel to it, like a prepackaged, factory-sealed, product. Every one of his mini-verses seem like such cliff notes versions of rap music tropes, it\\'s insulting. . Like, dude, come on, LIE TO ME. Can you at least pretend like you\\'re more than \"the go-to guy for optional rap verses on pop songs\"? You know how on some radio stations, they\\'ll cut out the rap verse of a song, leaving you with 30 seconds of an awkward voiceless backtrack, as you rap along to words that you could swear were there the last time you heard it? \"California Gurls\". Yeah, because apparently there\\'s still a large amount of people out there who just can\\'t stand the thought of rappers in popular music, so much so that there are radio stations across the country who market themselves on the idea that, \"Hey, if you listen to us, you don\\'t have to wory about all that pesky rap nonsense that\\'s ruining music!\" *play intro to \"California Gurls\". Wait, they even cut him out of the intro? He\\'s not even rapping there!. . I have NEVER heard of something like this happen to other genres of music. I\\'ve never heard of a radio station dedicated to editing out violins and saxophone solos from songs because some people don\\'t like jazz or classical music. In fact, I\\'ve never heard of a rap station that prides itself on cutting pop singers out of rap songs, but when it comes to rappers on pop songs, people are still saying \"get that damn talky noise out of my ear,\" so much so that you can bank your radio station\\'s appeal on that sentiment alone? That\\'s… disappointing, to say the least. Wait, who were we talking about again? Oh yeah, Pitbull. Sorry, I got distracted by something interesting.... . But yeah, Pitbull to me, always ends up sounding like a guest artist on his own songs most of the time. In fact, I\\'m surprised no radio station\\'s gotten confused and accidentally cut the the rap verses out of his own songs. *example of Pitbull\\'s song being edited*. You know, I reviewed a Flo Rida song a year or so ago, and the only reason I decided to do so was because it was called \"I Cry\", and a title like that meant that maybe he would say something I could actually make a full episode ago. And, well, he did say a few things, but for the most part, it was kinda typical. But hey, at least there was that initial interest. Now, Pitbull\\'s a little different from Flo, in that, admittedly, his Spanish heritage gives him a a little bit of flavor to his lyrics, but not in a really substantial way. But, like Flo Rida, I figure if I do hear a song from that sounds like it\\'ll stand out, I give it a try. . Then, I heard this song, \"Timber\". *song intro* Well that\\'s…certainly different. A country western rap song from a guy from Cuba and a woman who was obviously raised in… in… Nashville, Tennessee? Oh… well, she doesn\\'t sound like it! *beat switches to typical club music* Uh… and neither does this song anymore. Really, the harmonica is the only thing keeping the country theme together. And yeah, the sample comes from a 70\\'s bluesy song, but… look at this video. I think you know what they\\'re going for. . It’s going down, I’m yelling timber. You better move. . I will say, that\\'s a relatively witty, catchy first lyric. Unfortunately, I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s strong enough to build a whole song around,  but given how generic the rest of the chorus is, it leads me to believe that that first lyric was the only reason this song was made.  Like, they were thinking, \"Hey, guys, how\\'s this: \"it\\'s going down... like someone shouted timber, get it?\" And… uh… rednecks like trees, right? Rednecks, lumberjacks, same thing, am I right? Am I right, fellas? No, seriously, is that right? I don\\'t know…. . \"Let\\'s make a night *Or, a song* you won\\'t remember\". . Okay, let\\'s stop wasting time. Let\\'s get to pit bull. So basically, let\\'s waste more time.... . The bigger they are, the harder they fall. You might also likeOkay, that\\'s not a bad opener, continuing with the trees-slash-party metaphor, in that the bigger the tree or the bigger the party, the more intensely hard it\\'s gonna go down. That\\'s… ok. . This biggity boy’s a dignity dog. . Also, I appreciate the callback to the 90\\'s with the Das EFX\\'s placement of \"iggety\" in the middle of words, which is fitting, because it pays homage to the HipHop tradition that, even back in the 90\\'s, rappers could get famous off of spitting a bunch of unimportant nonsense. Seriously, listen to \"They Want EFX\" and tell me it held some deep message about the human condition:. . My thigh bone\\'s connected to my knee bone. My knee bone\\'s connected to my hardy-har-har-har. . No Parks sausages, mom, please. . Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh I\\'m steamin, a-go-ny!. . B - I - N - G - O-oh. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, hon, so uh. Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun. . I\\'m pretty sure those guys just got high and tried to reference everything from their childhood as quickly as possible. Hm… I wonder if they went on to write for Family Guy. *play \"Price is Right\" loser horn, look to camera, shrug shoulders*. . I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off. Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber. . I understand that Miley Cyrus is a buzz word right now when it comes to twerking, but *show miley twerking*  I don\\'t think that\\'s because she was good at it. . Face down, booty up, timber. That’s the way we like the what, timber. Okay, really, what is up with rappers censoring themselves on the uncensored versions of songs. I get it if it\\'s done for an effect, like a joke or something, but THIS lyric is a reference to a very explicit 2 Live crew song:. . \"FACE DOWN, ASS UP, THAT\\'S THE WAY WE LIK TO FUCK\". . And he\\'s not making a joke about it, he sounds like he was tapped on the shoulder and told to make the lyric less explicit by saying \"booty\" instead ass and saying \"that\\'s the way we like to WHAAT!?\" like his parents just walked in while he was recording the lyrics. . \"Face down, booty up, that\\'s the way we like to WHAT!?! Mom, dad, you weren\\'t supposed to be in the studio today?!. . Look, when the only reason you\\'re self-censoring your words is so because you\\'re actively trying to be more radio friendly, then just erase the lyrics and say something else!. . Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane. Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed. . I guess that\\'s an okay reference, saying that even though people may seem him as someone whose ego\\'s reached a great height as far as fame and wealth are concerned, he\\'s still a down to earth guy, but… when you watch the video, it ruins any charm it might have had. He just looks so smug about a line that wasn\\'t really that great. *show his face* Get it, I compared myself to superman, hehe… well, I thought it was funny…*. . Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli. . You know, I would be angry about this blatant interruption of the song for the sole purpose of product placement, but honestly, I\\'ll take this over what he did on the \"Give Me Everything\" song, which, at the very start of the song, synergized repetition of product placement with the fact that rhyming words with themselves has become openly accepted as a way to rap in order to give us this gem:. . Me not working hard?. Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak. Or, better yet, go to Times Square. Take a picture of me with a Kodak. . Why yes, Pitbull DID have a deal with Kodak. How did you know? Well, anyways, let\\'s get back to the verse:. Swing your partner round and round. End of the night, it’s going down. One more shot, another round. End of the night, it’s going down. . Oh, I\\'m sorry, I must have skipped to the bridge near the end of the song, let\\'s back up by about 45 seconds. . Swing your partner round and round. End of the night, it’s going down. . Wait, I\\'m sorry, I went too far back! Now, we\\'re in the middle of the first verse, and… wait, keep playing that part. . One more shot, another round. End of the night, it’s going down. . …No… This man, instead of making two full verses, just repeated a two bar phrase for the second  half of BOTH verses. You… cheater!!! Dude, n… really? You just COULDN\\'T be bothered to write two complete verses? I mean, hey, I guess that makes both our jobs easier. Whatever, you know what? I give this a 2 out of 5. . You could give this song credit for trying to do the country western approach with the harmonica, and the intro that sounds like a more bluesy/country western feel. And to Pit\\'s credit, he\\'s... just not on the song long enough to annoy me. His mannerisms are there, but they\\'re tolerable. Well, except for the \"just repeat one phrase to substitute as the second half of the verse\" thing. It\\'s so obviously jarring to hear, because to my ear, it truly feels like he ran out of things to say and just plugged in the bridge that was supposed to go at the end to make up for unfinished verses. As well, after a while, the phrase \"it\\'s going down\" is used so much, it starts to feel like one of the writers was someone\\'s out-of-touch dad who just figured out what \"it\\'s going down\" meant, and REALLY wanted his kids to know that he was hip to the lingo. . It\\'s goin\\' down. It\\'s going down. It\\'s goin\\' down. It\\'s going down. It\\'s goin\\' down. IT\\'S, ABOUT, TO GO, DOWN!. . After a while it starts to feel forced, like they\\'re TRYING to make it popular, or people JUST started saying it and they\\'re trying to make it the new Y.O.L.O. or something, but it doesn\\'t have enough personality or catchiness to do so. Well, I\\'m the Rap Critic!. . You don\\'t have to like my opinion, but I don\\'t have to like your song...Embed',\n \"67 ContributorsCool Kids Lyrics[Verse 1].

They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce.

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them.

[Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed',\n '338 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsΕλληνικάDeutschFrançaisShape of You Lyrics[Verse 1].

By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter. [THOMAS JEFFERSON]. And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted. Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up. Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of. The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter. . [JAMES MADISON]. Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned. Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain. Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain. And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain. . [BURR]. Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”. Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland. “Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and. The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”.

I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen\\'ll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin\\' and a killin\\' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin\\' on his nutsack. I\\'m an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill \\'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don\\'t really wanna get into a pissin\\' match. With this rappity brat, packin\\' a MAC in the back of the Ac\\'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I\\'m practicin\\' that. I\\'ll still be able to break a motherfuckin\\' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin\\' a rough time period, here\\'s a maxi pad. It\\'s actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I\\'m masterfully constructing this masterpièce.

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin\\' this shit ain\\'t that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint\\'s. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. \\'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I\\'m a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin\\' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I\\'ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I\\'ll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it\\'s all a game, \\'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin\\'?. Little gay-lookin\\' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin\\' boy (Ha-ha!). You\\'re witnessin\\' a mass-occur. Like you\\'re watching a church gathering take place, lookin\\' boy. \"Oy vey, that boy\\'s gay!\"—that\\'s all they say, lookin\\' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin\\' boy. Hey, lookin\\' boy! What you say, lookin\\' boy?. I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin\\' boy. I\\'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin\\' boy!. Basically, boy, you\\'re never gonna be capable. Of keepin\\' up with the same pace, lookin\\' boy, \\'cause—. [Chorus]. I\\'m beginnin\\' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I\\'m racin\\' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet\\'s Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard. . [Verse 3]. So you\\'ll be Thor and I\\'ll be Odin. You rodent, I\\'m omnipotent. Let off, then I\\'m reloadin\\'. Immediately with these bombs I\\'m totin\\'. And I should not be woken. I\\'m the walkin\\' dead, but I\\'m just a talkin\\' head, a zombie floatin\\'. But I got your mom deep-throatin\\'. I\\'m out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin\\' in common, poodle. I\\'m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It\\'s me, my honesty\\'s brutal. But it\\'s honestly futile if I don\\'t utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin\\'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I\\'m Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I\\'ll take seven kids from Columbine. Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal. You\\'re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don\\'t know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You\\'re pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin\\' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad. Singin\\' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I\\'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin\\' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin\\' I\\'m a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I\\'m superhuman. Innovative and I\\'m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin\\' off of me and it\\'ll glue to you and. I\\'m devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed',\n \"121 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisLove Me Harder Lyrics[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]. Tell me something I need to know.

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida. Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver. Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa. My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors. Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers. No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward. Face just showered, the minute in a hour. Heard about the news, whole day went sour. Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head. Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes. Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested. Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless. Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace. DUI never said I was driving reckless. You and I know that jealously is not impressive. Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined. You might also like[Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]. I know. Caught up in the middle. I cry, just a little.

Get the pressed leather outfit all in it. 'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket. Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit. Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid. Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics. Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing. Look at me steering, got the bossing staring. Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren. Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet. Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries. Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit. Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish. Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish. No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic. [Chorus: Kelli-Leigh with Flo Rida]. I know. Caught up in the middle. I cry, just a little.

I don't wanna chase you down but I know you see it. You run with me and I can cut you free. Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in. So trade that typical for somethin' colorful. And if it's crazy, live a little crazy. You can play it sensible, a king of conventional. Or you can risk it all and see. . [Chorus: Hugh Jackman]. Don't you wanna get away. From the same old part you gotta play. 'Cause I got what you need so come with me and take the ride. It'll take you to the other side. 'Cause you can do like you do or you can do like me.

Well, I hate to tell you but it just won't happen. So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go. 'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in. Now I admire you and that whole show you do.

Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns. But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little. Just let me give you the freedom to dream. And it'll wake you up and cure your achin'. Take your walls and start 'em breakin'. Now that's a deal that seems worth takin'. But I guess I'll leave that up to you. . [Verse 3: Zac Efron & Hugh Jackman]. Well, it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly. So what percentage of the show would I be taking?. Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action. I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen. I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine. Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?. Fifteen. I'd do eight. Twelve.

Scoldin\\' hot as dunkin\\' scrotum in a Folgers cup. Or Nevada, drivin\\' drunk inside a stolen truck. And shittin\\' like his colon bust. Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum. Supernova, I\\'m rollin\\' over the novices. And roamin\\' through the forest and spittin\\' cold as his porridge is. Stay gold \\'til the case closed and the story end. Post mortem porkin\\' this rap shit and record it. To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips. Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list. Stormin\\' the gate, ensurin\\' the bass.

For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case \\'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin\\' at me like it\\'s lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I\\'m on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine.

Put \\'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain\\'t as big as I was, but I\\'m. Morphin\\' into an immortal, comin\\' through the portal.

And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. \\'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather\\'s pad.

How to give a motherfuckin\\' audience a feeling like it\\'s levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they\\'ll be celebrating. \\'Cause I know the way to get \\'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he\\'s too mainstream.\". Well, that\\'s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It\\'s not hip-hop, it\\'s pop,\"—\\'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make \\'em lose it. \"I don\\'t know how to make songs like that. I don\\'t know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I\\'m rippin\\' any one of these verses that versus you. It\\'s curtains, I\\'m inadvertently hurtin\\' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself \\'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I\\'m a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it\\'s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I\\'m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I\\'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin\\' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there\\'s something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here\\'s what they want from me. They\\'re askin\\' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life\\'s handin\\' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can\\'t batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake \\'em a cake then?. Don\\'t mistake him for Satan. It\\'s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don\\'t be a retard—be a king? Think not.

Sentado esperando a salvação, é melhor não, vai demorar. Vamos se armar, se preparar, atento sem ignorar. Correr, derramar todo suor e no final comemorar. Joga fora os ideais, construídos pelos nossos rivais. Um cagueta por perto jamais, ao redor só parceiro leais. Muito trampo e poucos reais, holerite, merreca no troco. Sem limite moleque quer mais, tendeu? Baguio ta loco. Ó, necessário se sujeito, ó, resposta levo no peito. Sei que se azedar logo da um jeito, pise firme, mantenha o respeito. Preto, perfil de um suspeito, grana, perfil sempre aceito. Música injetando orgulho, se o jogo virar, bem feito. Ó, de manhã acordo, mas o Sol nem raiou, uma ducha gelada. Esse é o trabalhador, ta fugindo da dor, sangue na caminhada. Deus me deu essa luz, pra ser porta voz, da voz que segue calada. Vento sopra, mas tamo de pé, porque nossa fé não vai ser abalada. . [Refrão: Denna Hill](2X). Trabalhar, trabalhar. Enriquecer com dinheiro do povo é mó faia, mó faia. Pode pá que nóiz vamos pegar no pé. E é preciso andar com fé, pra conseguir o que nóiz quer. . [Verso 2: Rincon Sapiência]. Anda com fé, que a fé não costuma faia, salve Gilberto Gil. Salário ridículo é a real que político não viu. O ensino público revela o trabalhador do Brasil. Moleque no topo do morro é o trabalhador de fuzil. Não falo de religião, falo de uma força maior. Que vai cobrar cada um que explora o trampo dos menor. Com disposição, arma na mão, muitos falam sem dó. Ai se eu te pego e não é como aquele som do Teló. Ó, por isso que cantamos com dificuldade brigamos. Ó, ocupando as terra ferramente é a música plantamos. Ó, diz a filosofia existimos enquanto pensamos. É assim pela periferia, resistimos enquanto lutamos. Anda com fé, né? Pode botar um fé, né?. Nem tudo que dizem que é, é. Informe-se enquanto puder, né?. Fardo pesado, busão lotado, longa viagem de pé, né?. Na correria, salve Dona Maria, salve José. You might also like[Refrão](2X). .

Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky. I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly. But I never thought I'd be alone to try. Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations. We were still alone, my wife and I. Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over. Now I work to bring my family stateside. . [Pre-Chorus]. But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast. Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most. . [Chorus]. I took a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh). I took a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh). . [Verse 2]. Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss. I remind myself that times could be much worse. My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask. And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse. Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights. Then decided she would stay the rest of her life. I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen. And I sit and pray they never feel my strife. You might also like[Pre-Chorus].

Honey, it's your son, I think I borrowed just too much. We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front. And, tonight, I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young. Tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids. We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes. But, see, I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees. I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need. . [Chorus]. I took a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk. Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh). I took a walk.

If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; . And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\". \"You are just what the doc ordered\". . [Chorus]. I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot. [Verse 1]. But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it. Got a fat knot from that rap profit. Made a livin' and a killin' off it. Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office. With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack. I'm an MC still as honest. But as rude and as indecent as all hell. Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with). This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop. You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match. With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'. Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack. And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that. I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table. Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half. Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact. How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce. You might also like[Chorus]. 'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got. . [Verse 2]. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's. Simply rage and youthful exuberance. Everybody loves to root for a nuisance. Hit the Earth like an asteroid. Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!). MCs get taken to school with this music. 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\". Now I lead a new school full of students. Me? I'm a product of Rakim. Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren. Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim. Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position. To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them. Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames. Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of shame. You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?. Little gay-lookin' boy. So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!). You're witnessin' a mass-occur. Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy. \"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"—that's all they say, lookin' boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy. Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?. I get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy. I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit. Get outta my face, lookin' boy!. Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable. Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—. [Chorus]. I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard. . [Verse 3]. So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin. You rodent, I'm omnipotent. Let off, then I'm reloadin'. Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'. And I should not be woken. I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'. But I got your mom deep-throatin'. I'm out my Ramen Noodle. We have nothin' in common, poodle. I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil. It's me, my honesty's brutal. But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though. For good at least once in a while. So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes. To maybe try to help get some people through tough times. But I gotta keep a few punchlines. Just in case 'cause even you unsigned. Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime. I know there was a time where once I. Was king of the underground. But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind. So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine. Appeal with the skin color of mine. You get too big and here they come tryin'. To censor you like that one line. I said on \"I'm Back\" from The Mathers LP 1 when I. Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine. Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9. See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm. Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal. You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though. And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for. You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows. You write normal? Fuck being normal!. And I just bought a new raygun from the future. Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad. 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad. Singin' to a man while he played piano. Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel. So Ray J went straight to the radio station. The very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\". Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad). Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human. What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman. Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and. I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating. How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating. Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting. For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating. 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated. I make elevating music, you make elevator music. \"Oh, he's too mainstream.\". Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it. \"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it. With rock, shock rap with Doc. Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it. \"I don't know how to make songs like that. I don't know what words to use.\". Let me know when it occurs to you. While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you. It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you. How many verses I gotta murder to. Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!. Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie. But look at the accolades these skills brung me. Full of myself, but still hungry. I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to. And I'm a million leagues above you. Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you. I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel. I'ma sleep in the front seat. Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\". But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling. Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me. They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate. But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred. I have, then you may be a little patient. And more sympathetic to the situation. And understand the discrimination. But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!. But if I can't batter the women. How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?. Don't mistake him for Satan. It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation. To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and. Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not. Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7KEmbed","count":25},{"name":"1915 others","count":2398}]}},{"name":"_deepnote_index_column","dtype":"int64"}],"rows":[{"Unnamed: 0.1":"0","Nom":"As It Was","Artiste":"Harry Styles","Genre":"pop","Annee":"2022","Paroles":"[Intro]   Come on   Harry   we wanna say goodnight to you         [Verse 1]   Holdin' me back   Gravity's holdin' me back   I want you to hold out the palm of your hand   Why don't we leave it at that?
